            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And how in all Ages under the Promiſe our Saviour was repreſented by Types and Figurative Shadows, till his Bleſſed Incarnation. Secondly, A brief Account of his Birth, Holy and Exemplary Life, his bitter Death and Paſſion; as likewiſe his Glorious Reſurrection and Aſcenſion.
<pb facs="tcp:57946:4"/>
Thirdly, The Lives of the Glorious Apoſtles and Evangeliſts: In which is contained their ſeveral Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their great Courage to promote the Goſpel in Barbarous Nations with all the chief place of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes, perillous Journies and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions they met withall, what Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants they conteſted with, and by what means they came to be Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Martyrdom, <hi>and ſo lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down their Lives became more than Conquerors;</hi> what multitudes they converted by their Preaching and Patient Sufferings, baffling all the power and malice of Hell.

Endeavours carried on the great work of the Goſpel, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Evangeliſts left off, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Relation of their Sufferings and Martyrdoms for near <hi>1200</hi> years after our Saviours Birth; their Conteſts with Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Tyrants, and Hereticks; most of them reſiſting even to Blood. Faithfully Collected out of Sacred Writ, the Voluminous Histories of their lives, and ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories as have been approved of by the true primitive Church in all Ages, and in ſuch a Method that it is well hoped it will find Acceptance amongſt all true Chriſtians and that they will make ſuch uſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, by ſtriving to imitate and

                  <p>NO ſooner had our firſt Parents, by Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Forbidden Fruit, difrobed themſelves of that Innocence by which they held their State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but the Eternal and All-wiſe Creator out of the Abundance of his never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy and Goodneſs found a means to reſcue them and all their Poſterity from the Power and Malice of Satan, and gave them a Promiſe even when he was paſſing Sentence, that <hi>the Seed of the woman ſhould break the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. which was fulfilled in that our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour.</p>

and Glorious Triumph over Death, the Grave, and Hell, the Patriarchs and Prophets all along had foreſeen. Nay, God was often pleaſed to renew his Promiſe; as next to faithful <hi>Abraham:</hi> For to him was it directly revealed, that out of his Loyns the Meſſiah ſhould proceed. After his Deceaſe, God made it known to <hi>Jacob</hi> out of what Tribe of the Jewiſh Nation he ſhould come; which that Bleſſed Patriarch revealed at his Death in theſe words, viz. <hi>that the Scepter ſhould not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet till Shil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h came.</hi> Next <hi>Moſes</hi> told the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God would raiſe up a Prophet of their Brethren like unto him, and that unto him ſhould they hearken. Nor were the Jewiſh Ceremonies from time to time any other than Types and Figures of our Bleſſed Saviour; as that of the Brazen Serpent, the Scape Goat, and others, and as the time of his Birth grew nearer, the Prophets had a more Lively and Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what ſhould happen during the time that was Decreed for his purchaſing our Redemption: For <hi>David</hi> abſolutely foretells his Sufferings and Powerful Reſurrection; as for his Death, that it ſhould be by piercing his hands and feet: And in Pſal. 16. ver. 10. he gives an undeniable Account of his Reſurrection in theſe words, <hi>For thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, neither ſuffer thy Holy One to ſee Corruption;</hi> and of his Aſcending up into Heaven, Pſal. 68 ver. 18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on High, thou haſt led Captivity Captive,</hi> &amp;c. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> lively deſcribing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Manner of his Birth, how that he was to be born of a Virgin and his Name called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> of his Incomparable Graces, Sanctity,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57946:6"/>
and fit Qualification for the performance of his Office; of the Entertainment he was like to meet with in the World; and of the Nature and Sign of thoſe Sufferings he was to undergo. The place of his Birth was foretold by <hi>Micah,</hi> Chap. 5. ver. 2. viz. <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Ephratah,</hi> the leſt of the Cities of <hi>Juda,</hi> but Honoured above the reſt by the Birth of a Prince who was to be <hi>Ruler in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whoſe goings forth had been from everlaſting.</hi> Again the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> fixes the Exact time, affirming that the Meſſiah ſhould appear in the World, and be cut off as a Sacrifice for the Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Sins of the People, at the Expiration of 70 Prophetical weeks or 490 years, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>For that Date being expired, <hi>In the fulneſs of time God ſent his Son made of a woman made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law.</hi> And becauſe it was not fit ſo great a Perſon ſhould come into the World, or be made publick without ſome extraordinary <hi>prodromos,</hi> not only the Angel told his Birth to the Shepherds feeding their Flocks by Night, but likewiſe a Star hanging as it were in the Air appeared to the Eaſtern <hi>Magi,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to the place where he lay to pay Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Adoration <hi>to the Sun of Righteouſneſs, who was riſen with healing under his wings:</hi> Nor did our Bleſſed Lord want in any thing to fulfil and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all the Ceremonies of the Law which was only a Type and Shadow of his Coming, or as a pledge of the Sacred Promiſe made in Paradiſe, he being that Bleſſed Seed of the Woman which was to break the Serpent's head, and by that means to deliver us from the power of Satan, who ſo long had Tyrannized over Mankind; bewitching
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57946:7"/>
the greateſt part of the World to Worſhip him under divers and ſundry Names; for as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet has it, God himſelf declared that only <hi>in</hi> Juda <hi>was his name known,</hi> and from thence the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called the holy City by reaſon all the Tribes once a year at the Feaſt of the Paſſover went up to Worſhip and that no other place for the General Aſſembly was appointed.</p>
                  <p>Eight days after the Birth of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, he ſo far ſubmitted himſelf to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or rather to the fulfilling of the Law, as to be Circumciſed, and his was name called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the Angel had foretold at the time he brought the joyful Tidings to the Bleſſed Virgin, when he declared unto her that ſhe ſhould Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Holy Ghoſt, and that the Power of the Higheſt ſhould over-ſhadow her. But long he had not been born before the Powers of Darkneſs, foreſeeing their Kingdoms fall, raiſed up a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him, inſpiring wicked <hi>Herod</hi> with Diabolick Rage to purſue the Life of him from whom whatever was created had had its prime Original. And although the Bloudy Tyrant miſſed his Aime yet not knowing he was fled from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he commanded all the Males that were found not only in the City, but in all that Coaſt from two years old and under to be put to death, thinking, that in that General ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, He might fall whom he underſtood was to be King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For as it is written in the 2d. of <hi>Matthew</hi> the 6th. verſe; <hi>And thou</hi> Bethlehem <hi>of the Land of</hi> Juda <hi>art not the leaſt amongſt the Princes of</hi> Juda <hi>for out of thee ſhall come a Governour that ſhall rule my people</hi> Iſrael; And in this the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was fulfilled, <hi>In</hi> Rama <hi>was there a

voice heard, lamentation and weeping, and great mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they are not.</hi> When our Bleſſed Lord was twelve years old, at the Feaſt of the Paſſover he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with his Parents, viz. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and there in the Temple ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, he both heard them and asked them ſuch Queſtions that all who heard him ſtood amazed. The next Conformity we find in him was, that after his Parents had found him out, he went down with them and for a long time after continued with them being as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>obedient or ſubject unto them,</hi> even according to the Evangeliſts till the 30 year of his Age, it being upon the year of Jubilee which was by the <hi>Jews</hi> held as the great <hi>Sabatical</hi> year; in which at the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, all the Captives and Servants were ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as likewiſe Priſoners releaſed, Debts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and Mortgaged Eſtates reverted to their proper Heirs; and how evidently this did ſhadow out the State of the Goſpel and our Lord's being <hi>ſent to preach glad tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to preach liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound to proclaim the Acceptable year of the Lord, that they might lift up their heads becauſe their Redemption drew nigh</hi> (as we have it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18.) I leave to the Judgment of all Judicious men. Now to ſhew that he was a Prince he ſent his Herauld before him to Proclaim him to the World, viz. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was as the Prophet declares, <hi>the voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his path ſtrait;</hi> and <hi>lifting up his voice like a Trumpet, cryed, repent ye
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57946:8"/>
for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> He told the Jews that the Meſſiah they had ſo long expected was at hand, and his Kingdom ready to appear, and that the Son of God was come down from Heaven, a Perſon as far beyond him in Dignity, as in Time and Exiſtence, to whom he was not worthy to Adminiſter the meaneſt Offices (for ſo the Jews accounted the unloſing their Shoe-Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets) that he came to introduce a new and better State of things, and by taking away the Vail to give a full and clear proſpect into the Holieſt of Holieſts, calling him the Lamb of God that was to take away the Sins of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now at the Great Baptiſm by <hi>John,</hi> after the the Feaſt of the Tabernacle, being about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our <hi>November,</hi> our Bleſſed Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt came to <hi>Jordan;</hi> and to fulfill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther main Point of the Law, ſuffered himſelf to be Baptized, when coming up out of the River, the Heavens opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended on him in Bodily Shape like a Dove, and at the ſame time a Voice ſaying, this is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.12, 22.</p>
                  <p>And now our Bleſſed Saviour being fitly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and prepared to carry on the great work of our Redemption: And, as Witneſſes of his Glorious undertakings, and for the more Ample Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Eternal wellfare, he took unto him the Bleſſed Apoſtles, of the Hiſtory of whoſe Lives I ſhall afterwards give the Reader an Account.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Miracle that our Bleſſed Lord did, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Incarnation, was at a Marriage in <hi>Canaan</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where the great Admiration of all men at his Command the water was turned into Wine,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57946:8"/>
and after that, by the daily repetitions of ſuch Miracles as never Man did, the World ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed. A great part of which the holy Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have ſet down at large, to which I Refer the Pious Reader, having always before my Eyes the Caution which St. <hi>John</hi> gives us in his Revelations <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and if any man ſhall take away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe on the contrary the foregoing Verſe of the ſame Chapter threatens, that if any one ſhall add to thoſe things all the Plagues that are written in the Book ſhall be added unto him.</p>
                  <p>But to be brief, after our bleſſed Saviour, that glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs had run his courſe, he undertook to ſatisfie his Fathers Juſtice by making a propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of loſt and undone man, and ſuffered himſelf to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Betrayed, Scourged, Spit upon, Reviled, Crowned with Thrones, and laſtly ſubmitting even unto the Death of the Croſs, all which had been exactly foretold by the prophets. Though it happened not after the common manner, but was attended with ſuch diſmal darkneſs and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earthquakes. Inſomuch that a Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher at that Inſtant declared, that <hi>either the God of Nature ſuffered, or the world was at an end.</hi> But he could not long reſt under the power of the Grave, but as a Victorious Captain breaking the bonds of Death, he lead Captivity Captive in ſpite of the Malice of his Enemies who ſet a Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; for as we have it, <hi>Mat. Chap.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the firſt day of the week, came</hi> Mary Magdalene <hi>and the other</hi> Mary, <hi>to ſee the Sepulchre
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57946:9"/>
and behold there was a great Earth-quake, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled away the ſtone from the door and ſat upon it his Countenance was like Lightning, and his raiment white as Snow, and for fear of him the keepers did tremble, and became as dead men, and the Angel anſwered and ſaid unto the women, fear ye not, for I know that ye ſeek</hi> Jeſus <hi>which was Crucified, he is not here, but is riſen as he ſaid, come ſe ye place where the Lord lay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is this the only warrant of his Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but we have it confirmed by all the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles as being ſeen of them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times afterwards, nor will it be leſs than impious and Atheiſtical for any to make the leaſt doubt or ſcruple of it. But to proceed, after our bleſſed Lord was Aſcended up into Heaven he was not unmindful of the Promiſe he had made to his Diſciples while he was with them upon Earth, of ſending the Comforter to teach and guide them in the way of Truth: That Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without whoſe Divine Aſſiſtance all their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching had been vain, for although <hi>Paul may plant and Apollos water, yet 'tis God that gives the increaſe.</hi> For as our Bleſſed Lord had declared to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a little before he Aſcended to take his place at the right hand of his Father, God Bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. When they were asking him about Times and Seaſons, he told them, it was not for them to know the Times and Seaſons, which God had put in his Power. But ye (ſaid he) ſhall receive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be Witneſſes unto me, both in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and in all <hi>Judah,</hi> and in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and unto the utmoſt Parts of the Earth; <hi>Acts chap.</hi> 1.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57946:9"/>
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. Nor did the Holy Jeſus delay to ſend the Holy Spirit, as he had promiſed: For as we have it, <hi>Acts Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and when the day of Pentecoſt (which with us is called <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> being juſt 10 days after <hi>Aſcenſion-day</hi>) was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place, and ſuddenly there came a ſound from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, and it filled all the houſe where they were ſitting, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto them Cloven Tongues like as of Fire, and it ſat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpake with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Thus being prepared (as a Giant refreſhed with Wine) to run the Glorious Race and ſend their ſounds unto the utmoſt Ends of the Earth, they ſpared not to Lift up their Voices like a Trumpet, to make known the Will of the Lord, and preach the glad Tidings of the Goſpel which was ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed with their great Maſter's blood; and now they began to ſpeak with divers Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance to the Confounding and Amazing of all that heard them: Nor were their words common words, or empty Air, but of ſuch Power and Efficacy that they made deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the hearts of moſt that heard them, ſo that they were in doubt and amazed, ſaying to one another what meaneth this, <hi>Acts Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Such mighty operation has the Divine Spirit in the hearts of Men that at that inſtant by the preaching of St. <hi>Peter</hi> 3000 were added to the Church, and not only added, but continued ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread and of Prayer, <hi>Acts Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 42.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57946:10"/>And thus much for the Introduction, to ſhew in what State our Bleſſed Lord ſettled his Church which all Ages, Mauger the Malice of Men or Devils, has Continued and will Continue unſpoted and unpolluted even to the End of the World, it being the Vine that his own right hand has plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will flouriſh in ſpite of all the wild Boars of the Forreſt that ſtrive to root her up, or the little Foxes that would pluck off her tender Branches.

                  <p>FIrſt I ſhall begin with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that great Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, who ſo long and earneſtly laboured for the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe obſtinacy had before drawn Tears from the Eyes of his Bleſſed Lord and Maſter, when he wept over it with, <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>hadſt thou but known even in this thy day the things that belonged unto thy peace, but now they are hidden from thine eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But to begin firſt with the place of his Birth, which was <hi>Bethſaida</hi> in the upper <hi>Galilee,</hi> antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to the Tribe of <hi>Nepthali,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Galilee</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which is now reduced (though formerly a famous City) into certain ſmall Cottages, and remaines only famous to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by reaſon it was the Birth-place of this great Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>The exact time of his Birth, notwithſtanding the conjectures and gueſſes, that have been made by divers Learned Men, remains as yet undecided; or as we may ſay altogether uncertain; by Reaſon what has been hitherto argued as to that point, has been only conjectural, and not firmly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any warrantable Authority. Moſt of the Fathers, that have written about the time of his Birth, take their ground from the Birth of our Saviour, by reaſon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> at what time our Bleſſed Lord called him to be one of his Diſciples,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57946:11"/>
was not only Married, but lived in a ſettled ſtate: therefore they judge he could not be leſs than 10 years elder than his Maſter; or according to <hi>Stenge,</hi> who builds his Foundation upon <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he was born in the Eighth year of <hi>Octavius Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> and in the 20 of King <hi>Herod</hi> which was about 17 years before the Birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p>His Father was <hi>Jonah</hi> of <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumciſed according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, had the name of <hi>Simon</hi> or <hi>Simeon</hi> given him at his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; to which our Saviour added the name of <hi>Cephas,</hi> which in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Language, then very much uſed among the Jews, ſignifies a <hi>Stone,</hi> or as the <hi>Greek</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">

And from the Alteration of his name, or rather addition, at ſuch time as he came to be our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Diſciple, the Popes have taken occaſion to alter their's at what time they come to the Papacy. His Brother was <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle, nor is it known which of them was the elder. He was a Man of ſmall Education when he was choſen by our Saviour as a Diſciple, but was ſoon after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Fountain of all Wiſdom and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, even the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Having proceeded thus far, I ſhall not think it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to give the Reader a Deſcription of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this famous Apoſtle (paſſing over for the moſt part ſuch paſſages of his Life, as are found in Sacred Writ, to be more Brief in this our purpoſe) according as he is deſcribed in Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.

And firſt, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> declares, he was ſomewhat ſlender, of a middle ſize, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Tallneſs; his Complexion very pale and almoſt white; the Hair of his Head curled and thick, but very ſhort, though St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us (as he has it out of <hi>Clemens</hi> his Periods) that he was exceeding Bald, which might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enough be, in his declining Age; his Eyes black, unleſs ſome ſmall ſpecks of Red, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Fathers have attributed to his often weeping; his Eye-brows very thin; his Noſe long, though at the end broad or flat. And thus have I deſcribed the outſide of this Admirable Man, according as it has been derived down to Poſterity by ſuch as lived in his time, and had often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him and now ſince the outſide is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; it will not be amiſs to give a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his Temper, and the Internal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Soul. Firſt then, He was Eager and Fierce, Witneſs his encountering the Guard of Souldiers that came to apprehend his Lord, and at that time cutting off the Ear of the High Prieſts Servant; his forwardneſs to ſpeak, and to return anſwers, though ſometimes to the endangering his Life, yet withal Courteous and Humble; for when <hi>Cornelius,</hi> being overjoyed with the Viſion of him, would have received him almoſt with Divine Adoration, he forbid him, telling him he was but a man ſubject to the Paſſions as other men.

                  <p>That he was Married, we have St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s word for it, he telling us, that <hi>one</hi> Cephas (which was undoubtedly <hi>Peter) went about leading with him a Wife and a Siſter;</hi> and as it is recorded by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Fathers, a Daughter; and as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> tells us, that when St. <hi>Peter</hi> beheld his Wife going to her Martyrdom he exceedingly rejoyced, calling to her aloud, and charging her to be mindful of our Lord.

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57946:12"/>When he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he propheſied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation by <hi>Veſpaſian:</hi> But about that time the Perſecution growing hot againſt the Chriſtians, eſpecially upon <hi>Nero</hi>'s return from <hi>Achaia</hi> in great Pomp, he at that time reſolving to glut himſelf with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood, cauſed ſeveral thouſands of the Chriſtians to be ſhut up in Priſons, and amongſt the reſt St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for whoſe preſervation the Prayers of the Chriſtians were ſtill put up to Heaven many of the chief of them who could gain Acceſs perſwading him earneſtly to make his eſcape, alledging that the preſervation of his Life would be greatly uſeful to the Church.

                  <p>He was born at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> one of the Capital Cities of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> a place much famed for Learning; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us that <hi>Julius Caſar</hi> made it a <hi>Roman</hi> Municip, or Free Corporation all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof having the ſame priviledges as the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were likewiſe confirmed to them by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> who ſucceeded him in the Empire.</p>

                  <p>His firſt Name was <hi>Saul,</hi> the which he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued till the time of his Converſion in his way to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of his Life we find nothing memorable, but when he grew up to manhood he became a great Perſecutor of the Chriſtians; and the firſt time he is mentioned in Holy Writ, is when he held or looked to the Cloathes of ſuch as Stoned the Bleſſed Proto-Martyr St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he continuing to breath out threatenings againſt the Church, procured Letters or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as the Hebrew renders it, from the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Council, in which the High Prieſt was wont to fit Chief Judge, impowering him to bring ſuch as he found preaching in the name of Jeſus, bound to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But Lord! whilſt he was on his Journey, in order to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting this wicked deſign, <hi>A light from heaven ſhined round about him; inſomuch that he fell to the Earth, and heard a voice ſaying,</hi> Saul, Saul, <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> &amp;c. After the heavenly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition was departed, he, in obedience to what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57946:14"/>
he had been commanded by that Sacred Oracle, Journeyed on towards <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> but ſo blind, that his Servants were obliged to lead him. When he came there he prayed, till <hi>Ananias,</hi> a devout Chriſtian, came to him and reſtored his ſight, at which all his thoughts were changed: for whereas he ſome few days before had breathed out Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt the Church, ſo now, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he joyned himſelf to it, <hi>and began to preach boldly the Lord Jeſus;</hi> at which the <hi>Jews,</hi> being exceedingly incenſed, ſought to lay hands on him, and to deſtroy him: but God, who had made him <hi>a choſen Veſſel to bear his name before the Gentiles,</hi> delivered him out of their hands. From <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> he came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there eſſayed to joyn himſelf with the Brethren: but they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what manner of man he had formerly been, did not only fear to joyn with him, but in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood did what they could to avoid him; until they were certified, by one of their fellow Apoſtles, that he had ſeen the Lord Jeſus in the way; and that he was not only Converted, but had openly and boldly Preached the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>By this means, being received into their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, he in a ſhort time became their cheif ſpeaker: being a man of an exceeding ready Wit, as it appeared when at ſundry times he was brought before <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour, <hi>Feſtus</hi> his Succeſſor, and King <hi>Agrippa.</hi> There we ſee how he confounded the Orator, bafled all his Accuſers; Inſomuch that they could charge him with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his Religion in General, as not daring to venture upon any particulars, leaſt he ſhould have proved it out of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as he did Chriſt to be the Meſſia, foretold by all the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57946:14"/>
Prophets; when from Morning till Night he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted about the verity of the Goſpel which he Preached. But well perceiving that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was rather inclined to favour the People, than to do Juſtice, he thought it moſt convenient to Appeal to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which was a uſual Cuſtom and due Priviledge to ſuch as were either <hi>Romans</hi> or free of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereupon he is ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> when on the Coaſt of <hi>Melita,</hi> now <hi>Malta,</hi> in the <hi>Lybian</hi> Sea, between <hi>Syracuſe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the Ship ſuffered Wrack, yet God gave him not only his Life, but the Lives of all that were with him in the Ship. When he came on ſhore, he was kindly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Barbarians, who, when they had ſeen him ſhake of the Viper, that faſtened to his hand, and thereby receive no hurt; they ſayed amongſt themſelves, he was a God. Here he wrought many Miracles, by which he Converted a great number of the Inhabitants to the Faith, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Publius</hi> the Chief Officer, or Governour of that Iſland, whoſe Father he had reſtored to health being at the point of Death; who afterward, as many of the learned affirm, was Biſhop of <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſuffered Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>From this Iſland, after 3 months ſtay, he with the reſt were put on board the <hi>Caſtor and Pollux,</hi> a Ship of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> bound for <hi>Italy;</hi> which, putting in at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> there ſtayed 3 days; from from thence they ſailed to <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teoli,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> found many Chriſtians ſtaying amongſt them, the better to confirm them, for the ſpace of Seven days; and from hence departed for <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the news of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Approach he was met by a Troop of Chriſtians, above 50 Miles from the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57946:15"/>
City, who ſtill increaſing, as he came nearer, they brought him into <hi>Rome</hi> as it were in Triumph: where, when he came, he found ſuch favour at the hands of the Captain of the Guard, that he only confined him to his own houſe, and ſet one Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to watch; who was appointed rather to waite upon him, than to ſecure him.</p>
                  <p>He had not long continued there before he was brought before <hi>Nero,</hi> who then ſat Emperour; where he ſo well acquitted himſelf that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Liberty, and lived free in a houſe of his own, for the ſpace of 2 years, Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt boldly in the City, and confirming many in the Faith: Converting not only thoſe of the meaner ſort, but thoſe of Rank and Quality. As one <hi>Torpes</hi> a cheif Officer in the Emperours Court, who afterward ſuffered Martyrdom; as likewiſe <hi>Nero</hi>'s Cup-bearer, and others: but above all <hi>Poppaea Sabina</hi> an exceeding Beautiful Lady, and Concubine to <hi>Nero;</hi> which ſo enraged the Brutiſh Emperour that he reſolved the Apoſtle's death, which in a ſhort time he compaſſed: for as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> relates, when <hi>Nero</hi> found the Lady devoted to a ſtrict and chaſt Life, and that ſhe would by no means conſent any farther to his lude Deſires, he ſent for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and calling him Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, Impoſtor, and wretched perverter, he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be caſt into Priſon, whence he wrote to the Lady to perſwade her to continue ſtedfaſt in a Chaſt and Virtuous Life; for which the Tyrant commanded he ſhould be put to death.</p>
                  <p>How long he continued in Priſon, after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, is uncertain; but the day of his Execution ſoon came: but what his preparatory treatment was, whether he was Scourged, as Malefactors
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57946:15"/>
were wont, in order to their Death, is not known. As a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen by the <hi>Valerian</hi> and <hi>Porcian</hi> Law he was exempted from any ſuch Ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Infamous puniſhment, though by the Law of the 12 Tables Notorious Malefactors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the <hi>Centuriate</hi> Aſſemblies, were firſt to be ſcourged and then put to Death. And, as <hi>Baronius</hi> informes us, that in the Church of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> beyond the Bridg in <hi>Rome,</hi> two Pillars are yet to be ſeen, to which St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were bound, and ſcourged, before their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>As our Apoſtle was lead to execution, he is ſaid to have Converted 3 of the Soldiers who guarded him thither; which the Emperour hearing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould be put to death: St. <hi>Paul</hi> being come to the place appointed for his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was near the <hi>Aquae Salviae</hi> 3 miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had exhorted ſuch as came to ſee the Tragedy performed, to Repentance, and recommended his Spirit into the hands of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Maſter; he kneeling down had his head ſtricken off with a Sword; which by the <hi>Romans</hi> was counted the nobleſt death, and only allowed to ſuch, as were either Citizens, or free of the City.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> declares, that his chearful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to Death, and his conſtant courage till the laſt, was a means not only to Convert his Executioner, but ſeveral others who afterwards ſuffered Martyrdom, for the Faith of Chriſt. He was Executed, as far as can be gathered, in the 68 year of his Age; and farther 'tis ſaid, that when his head was ſtricken off, Milk inſtead of Blood flowed from the Wound, and thus this great
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57946:16"/>
Apoſtle after he had preached the Goſpel to the Gentiles, and either in Perſon, or by his Epiſtles viſited moſt of the known World, and, as <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> tells us, in the Iſles of the Sea, (whereby he undoubtedly means <hi>Brittain</hi>) he received firſt the Crown of Martyrdom, and then the Palm and Crown of Glory.</p>
                  <p>He was buried <hi>in via Oſtienſis,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> over whoſe Grave, about 318 years after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, at the requeſt of Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> built a ſtately Church, and endowed it with many rich Gifts and Priviledges; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was plucked down by the Emperour <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius,</hi> and rebuilt more ſtately than the former.</p>
                  <p>As for his Perſon, he was low of Stature, and ſomewhat ſtooping, his Complexion fair, his Countenance grave, his Head ſmall, his eyes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a kind of Beauty in them, his Eye-browes a little hanging over, his Noſe long, but gracefully bending, his Beard thick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>AS for the Place of this Apoſtle's Birth, as we find it in Holy Writ, it was <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> a City of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſtanding near to the Lake of <hi>Geneſareth,</hi> his Father being a Fiſher-man, and he Brother to <hi>Simon Peter;</hi> but which was the eldeſt remaines as yet undetermined. He with his Brother labouring in that Calling, till ſuch time as our Saviour took them to be his Diſciples, and made them Fiſhers of men. But at firſt he ſtayed not long with our Bleſſed Saviour, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, and betook himſelf to his former Calling, untill ſuch time, as our Saviour found him and his Brother Fiſhing upon the Sea of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and convinced them of their Unbelief, by the exceeding draught of Fiſhes; whereupon they left all and followed him: And therefore he is numbred amongſt the twelve that our Saviour took, as his immediate Witneſſes againſt the World, continuing all along with him, till ſuch time as he was Apprehended in the Garden; and then, moſt probably, fled with the reſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as had been foretold by the Prophet, <hi>I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the Sheep ſhall be ſcattered.</hi>

                  <p>After our Bleſſed Lord was Aſcended, and the Holy Ghoſt had, in its miraculous Power, been plentifully ſhred upon the Apoſtles, he departed for <hi>Scythia,</hi> and there Preached the everlaſting Goſpel, Converting many of thoſe wild and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57946:17"/>
People to the Faith, and true Belief of the Goſpel; Preaching as he went through <hi>Cappadocia, Galatia, Bithynia,</hi> and all along by the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, gaining many Proſelytes, notwithſtanding the Savageneſs of thoſe, who inhabited thoſe parts, who were formerly wont to Sacrifice Strangers, and drink out of their Sculls: And paſſing on he came to <hi>Sinope,</hi> the Burial-place of King <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> where it is ſaid he met St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and there they both taught the People; (And further 'tis added, that the Chaires, wherein they were wont to ſit, being of white ſtone, are there extant to this day). But the Inhabitants of the City being <hi>Jews</hi> for the greateſt part did what they could to oppoſe the Apoſtles Doctrine. So that ſetting upon the houſe wherein St. <hi>Andrew</hi> was, they attempted to put fire to it, but, however they were deterred from that, they caught the Apoſtle, and uſed him in a moſt Barbarous manner, till ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him dead they dragged him out of the City; But within a while he coming again to himſelf Re-entered the ſaid City, and by ſeveral Miracles ſo wrought upon them, that then they began more ſtedfaſtly to hear him Preach, which he continued for ſome time. But the Devil, that Enemy to the Progreſs of the Goſpel, ſoon ſtirred them up againſt him the ſecond time, whereupon he departed to <hi>Amyſon,</hi> and thence to <hi>Trapezus,</hi> thence to <hi>Neo-Caeſarea,</hi> thence to <hi>Samoſata;</hi> where having puzzled and confounded the Wiſdom, of the Philoſophers, he deſigned to viſit <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which he effected, When returning thence, he travelled through many Provinces Preaching the Goſpel till ſuch time as he came to <hi>Byzantium</hi> now <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> when he inſtructed them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                  <p>For as it is mentioned by <hi>Philaſtrius,</hi> who lived Anno 380, he going thither at what time <hi>Aegeas</hi> a wicked Pagan being Pro-Conſul, he Converted a great number to the Faith; which the Pro-Conſul perceiving, waxed exceeding angry, and uſed both Threats and fair means to ſtay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel, though all in vain; which increaſed his anger ſo far that he cauſed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to be brought before him, demanding how he durſt pervert (as he called it) the people from their Antient Worſhip? who with an undaunted Reſolution told him, that he taught them the right way to Everlaſting Happineſs; and that they having been brought up in Superſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, it was now high time for them to embrace ſaving Knowledge, and the Light of the Goſpel. At which the Pro-Conſul derided the Apoſtle as an Innovator and Propagator of <hi>that Religion, whoſe Author the Jews had infamouſly put to death upon a Croſs.</hi> Whereupon the Apoſtle began to declare the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love of our Lord, that he would vouchſafe to come down from Heaven, and by taking our Nature upon him, ſuffer Death for Loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Man, and that there was no other name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, by which any could be ſaved but by the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Upon this the Pro-Conſul
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57946:18"/>
growing more inraged, told him, that let who would believe it, as for his part he would not, and that if he (meaning St. <hi>Andrew</hi>) would not do Sacrifice to the Heathen Gods, he ſhould dye upon that Croſs, which he had preached, and ſo much Extolled. To which he replyed, <hi>that he did Sacrifice every day to God the Creator of the world and all things therein, yet not with fiery Sacrifices or bloody offerings, but in the Sacrifice of the Immaculate Lamb of God, who made himſelf an Offering for the attonement of the ſins of the World.</hi> Upon which the Tyrant commanded him to Priſon, which ſo troubled the People that had not the Apoſtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to Patience and Meekneſs they had Mutined.</p>
                  <p>The next day he was again brought into his Preſence who then began by many flattering De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to perſwade him not to deſtroy himſelf but live with him and enjoy the Pleaſures of Life. Upon which the Apoſtle told him, that if he would Renounce his Idolatries and Embrace the offers of the Goſpel, he ſhould have Eternal Life which was far exceeding what could be elſewhere expected; when as the Pro-Conſul told him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the reaſon why he urged him to Sacrifice to the Gods was, that by his Example ſuch as had fallen off might again return to the Antient wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, telling him that otherwiſe he ſhould ſuffer the exquiſiteſt Tortures that could be invented and that he ſhould be Inſtantly Crucified. To which the Apoſtle replyed, that now he ſaw it but in vain any longer to diſcourſe with or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to Repentance, he being hardened in his own folly and blindneſs; and that for this threats he had no regard to them, nor did he fear
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57946:18"/>
the utmoſt Tortures that he could invent as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould find the better acceptance at the hands of his Lord and Maſter, the more he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſake. Upon, which he was Condemned to be Crucified; and that which the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Pro-Conſul ſo to do, was, for that he had Converted his Wife <hi>Maximilia</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Stratocles</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, upon his having cured them of ſeveral deſperate Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, with which they were afflicted.</p>
                  <p>When he was Condemned, the Pro-Conſul or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be Scourged; and as he was going to be Crucified the People cryed out, he was a good and juſt man; yet he was faſtened upon the Croſs with Ropes, that he might be the longer dying, the Croſs being two beams ſet in the faſhion of the Letter X. From this Croſs, after he was faſtened to it, he Preached to the People for the ſpace of two days; and by his admirable Patience, Courage and Perſeverance, Converted many to the Faith. During his hanging there, great ſute was made to the Pro-Conſul for his Life, but our Apoſtle deſired them not to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for him, <hi>for that he was greatly deſirous to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Praying earneſtly to Heaven that he might at that time finiſh his Race, and be Crowned with Martyrdom: And ſo it happened, for he there gave up the Ghoſt; his better part Aſcending to his Maſters Joy. After which, his Body being taken down, was Embalmed at the Command of <hi>Maximilia,</hi> whom he had Converted, and afterwards layed in a Stately Tomb prepared for that purpoſe; where it continued till the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great,

and was at his Command brought to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and buried there in the Great Church which he had founded to the Honour of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> for whom the <hi>Scots</hi> for many Ages paſt have had ſuch Veneration, that they Stiled him the Patron of their Country; bearing his Croſs in their Standard: and, during the time that Popery overſpread that Kingdom, payed Divine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at his Shrine, and invoked his Aid upon all Occaſions.</p>

                  <p>ST. <hi>JAMES,</hi> ſirnamed the Great, either in reſpect of his Age, for the better diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the two Apoſtles of that name, or for ſome peculiar Favours our Lord beſtowed upon him above the reſt. By Birth he was a <hi>Galilean,</hi> but of what Town is uncertain; his Father was <hi>Zebedee,</hi> he being by Trade a Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being nearly related to the Mother of our Lord: This was he who, together with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, left their Father in the Ship, and followed Jeſus; not long after which he was called from the Station of an Ordinary Diſciple to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Office, and not that alone, but often honoured with extraordinary and peculiar Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, above the reſt; he being one of the 3 whom our Lord uſually made choice of to admit to the moſt private Tranſactions of his Life. As, with <hi>Peter</hi> and his Brother <hi>John,</hi> he was taken by our Saviour when he raiſed <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter to Life, as likewiſe a Spectator of our Saviour's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Transfiguration upon the Mount, and was with him in the Garden, at the time of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as likewiſe all along upon any Extraordinary occaſion. This was one of the Brethren whoſe Mother asked, for them of our Saviour, <hi>that one might ſit at his right hand, and the other at his left, in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57946:20"/>After our Saviour's Aſcenſion, <hi>Sophronius</hi> tells us, he Preached to the diſperſed Jews; which can be meant of no other than ſuch, as, for fear of the Perſecution, had ſeperated themſelves, that is the Chriſtians, who upon the Death of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> fled from their Habitation, as in many places Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory makes mention: But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fathers alledge, and greatly contend, that he, after he had preached the Goſpel in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> came into <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Weſtern parts, and there continued preaching for a long Seaſon. Some will have it, that he came from thence into <hi>Britain, Ireland</hi> and other Iſlands of the Sea; and after having appointed ſuch Diſciples, as he thought moſt convenient to carry on the work he had begun, he returned to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this no Antienter Writers, than ſuch as lived in the middle Age of the Church, give us any Account; when as 'tis mentioned by <hi>Iſidore,</hi> the Breviary of <hi>Toledo,</hi> an <hi>Arabick</hi> Book of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> concerning the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Martyrs, as likewiſe ſeveral others after them: But <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf, does not much credit what they have written, though he raiſed ſome Arguments to make it plauſible, the Apoſtle might take ſuch a Journey, though few believe, that the length of time, between his firſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the time of his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, could well permit it; but to leave that to the Judgment of the Reader I ſhall proceed.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57946:20"/>
Succeſſor to <hi>Caligula,</hi> obtained an Inlargement of his Dominions; he came from <hi>Rome</hi> to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſame, and being very zealous for the Jewiſh Religion, ſeldom ſuffering any day to paſs wherein he was not preſent at the Sacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very deſirous, at his Entry upon his additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soveraignty, for the better ingratiating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Hearts of the People, he could ſee no readier way to Effect it, than by perſecuting the Chriſtians: A ſort of men whom he well knew the Jews exceedingly hated, as profeſſing a Novel and upſtart Religion (as they termed it) which was quite contrary to the Moſaick Inſtitutions. Hereupon he cauſed a great number of Chriſtians to be Impriſoned, and Amongſt the reſt our Apoſtle, who, Maugre all his Malice, when the Perſecution raged moſt, Taught and Confirmed ſuch as were wavering.</p>
                  <p>A ſhort time after his Impriſonment Sentence of Death was paſſed upon him; and as he was led to the Place of Execution, according to <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> the Souldier or Officer who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the place of his Martyrdom; or as <hi>Suidas</hi> will have it, his Accuſer being Convinced, by the Courage and Bravery of the Apoſtle, in his chearfully going to his Death, came and fell down before him, asking Pardon for what he had done; upon which the Bleſſed man raiſed him from the ground, embraced, and kiſſed him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Peace my Son, peace be to thee, and a pardon of thy faults:</hi> Whereupon, before all the Aſſembly, he openly Confeſſed his Converſion, declaring the Chriſtian Faith to be the only means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, declaring that he was ready to dye for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57946:21"/>
the ſame: which accordingly he did, they being both beheaded at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Tyrant, he lived not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for coming into the Theatre, in glorious Apparel, to make a Speech to the People, on <hi>Caeſars</hi> Birth-day, they ſhouted, and ſayed, <hi>it was the voice of a God, and not of a man,</hi> which was ſoon diſproved; for, at that very moment, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice overtook him, and he was eaten up with Wormes.</p>
                  <p>As for the Body of our Apoſtle, it being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was from thence brought into <hi>Spain,</hi> and there ſaid to do many Miracles: but what Credit is to be given to that, I leave to the Readers Judgment.</p>

                  <head>The Life of St. <hi>JOHN</hi> the Evangeliſt.</head>
                  <p>ST. <hi>JOHN</hi> was younger Brother to St. <hi>James,</hi> by Birth a <hi>Galilaean,</hi> Son to <hi>Zebedee</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome,</hi> by Trade a Fiſher, as we find him noted in Holy Writ, being called at the ſame time that his Brother was and is noted as youngeſt of all the Diſciples. To this Diſciple it was that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>if I will that he ſhall tarry till I come,</hi> &amp;c. he alſo it was that leaned upon his Boſom, and had the Honour to wait upon him in the Hall, when he was Condemned, as alſo at the place where he ſuffered, and to whom our bleſſed Lord bequeathed the care of his Mother. At the firſt News of our Saviour's Reſurrection from the dead he, accompanied with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ran to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and he it was that firſt gave notice of it to the reſt of the Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>A while after we find that as he and <hi>Peter</hi> were preaching, they were caſt into Priſon, but being releaſed by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> they were choſen by all the Apoſtles to go down to <hi>Samaria;</hi> where meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> they confounded his falſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and not long after the Apoſtles dividing the Provinces amongſt them, <hi>Aſia Minor</hi> fell to his Lot, whither (after the death of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) he went and preached the Goſpel in many Cities, as in <hi>Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea,</hi> and others; and now coming nearer to <hi>Rome,</hi> and preaching the Goſpel,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57946:22"/>
he was accuſed to <hi>Domitian</hi> (that great Perſecutor of the Chriſtians) that he was an eminent Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Atheiſme, and a publick ſubverter of the Religion of the Empire, whereupon the Tyrant ſent an expreſs Command to the Proconſul of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to ſend him bound to <hi>Rome;</hi> which being done accordingly he was doomed to be put into a Caldron of boiling Oyl, in which, when he was entered, he ſtood for many hours unconcerned, nor any ways hurt, as <hi>Tortullian</hi> has it, which ſo amazed the Tyrant that he gave order he ſhould be taken out: but that Miracle not in the leaſt prevailing with him he baniſhed him to the Iſle of <hi>Patmos;</hi> a diſconſolate Iſland in the Archipelago, where he remained ſeveral years. There it was he wrote his Apocalypſe or Revelations, wherein by frequent Viſions and Prophetical repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had a clear proſpect of the ſtate and condition of the Church through all Ages which certainly was not the leaſt token of our Saviour's Love twards him: nor could it have been more ſuitable at any time; for then he was in a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly retirement, ſhut up from all Exerciſe or Converſe, it being rather a Priſon than an Iſland not being able to boaſt of any comfort but ſuch as he received from heaven.</p>
                  <p>A Story there is, but as for the Truth of it I ſhall no way aſſert, that a hand remaines to this day in a Monaſtery of Greeks Monks in that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, having large Nailes upon its Fingers, which as faſt as they pare them grow again; which, as <hi>Bellon</hi> in his Obſervations relates, is by ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be the ſame hand with which St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Revelations, and that the <hi>Turks</hi> will have it to be the hand of one of their Prophets: But enough of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57946:22"/>After the Death of <hi>Domitian, Cocceius Nerva</hi> ſucceeding him in the Empire he revoked many of his wicked Edicts, recalling ſuch as he had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; of which Indulgence St. <hi>John</hi> taking the advantage, left <hi>Patmos</hi> and returned again to <hi>Aſia</hi> his antient charge, but chiefly his fixed ſeat at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he had left <hi>Timothy</hi> as Biſhop or Preſident, who during his Abſence had been Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred by the People for perſwading them againſt their Heatheniſh Rites, Feaſts and Sports. St. <hi>John</hi> (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> reports) being arrived, cauſed ſeveral ſmall Churches for Divine Worſhip to be erected, ſuch as were conſiſtent with the poverty of the perſecuted Chriſtians, and that after he had ſettled the Affairs of the Provinces at the requeſt of the Biſhop of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he wrote his Goſpel, tho' ſome will have it that he wrote it in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos</hi> during his confinement there.</p>
                  <p>According to the beſt account that Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory gives us, he lived till about the beginning of <hi>Trajans</hi> Reign, and then being about 98 or 99 years old he died. Yet <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> will have it, that he lived 120 years, and that being 100 when he wrote his Goſpel he lived 20 years after; of the ſame Opinion is <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> but this ſeems ſomewhat improbable; for according to this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he muſt have been 50 years of Age when he was called to be a Diſciple, when all that write of him affirm him to be the youngeſt of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. He dyed ſaid the <hi>Arabian</hi> (as <hi>Kirſten</hi> has it in the Lives of the 4 Evangeliſts) in the expectation of his bleſſedneſs, from which he infers that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed peaceably, and not a violent Death; although <hi>Theophylact</hi> and others (but without any warrant) do conceive that he died a Martyr, their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57946:23"/>
being only grounded upon the words of our Saviour when he told him and his Brother they <hi>ſhould indeed drink of the cup whereof he drank and be Baptized with the baptiſme wherewith he was baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but &amp;c.</hi> Yet St. <hi>Hierome</hi> will have it expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another way, which is that all though he did not ſuffer by Execution, yet he being put into boiling Oyl, Baniſhed and Perſecuted, he ought to be accounted a Martyr, and that probably our Saviour meant ſuch like Calamity by the Cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many there are likewiſe who have cheriſhed a fond Opinion that he never dy'd, but rather that he ſleeps in his Grave; alluding to the words of our Saviour upon <hi>Peter's</hi> inquiry, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> John <hi>chap.</hi> 21. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Others ſay, that having commanded his Grave to be dug, he went into it, and ordered ſuch as went with him to faſten down a great ſtone upon the ſame, and come the next Morning and look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which they did, and found nothing there but the Grave-cloaths, from which, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates they concluded he was Aſcended, he having intimated ſome ſuch thing before his lying down. It is farther related that the duſt upon his Grave bubbles up, which ſome affirm is by reaſon of his Breathing; and that Manna or ſweet Perfume-like Flower is duly caſt out. But theſe I ſuppoſe are only Monkiſh Stories to amuſe the Ignorant, and ſince we have no certainty of any ſuch thing from any warrantable Author, I ſhall not trouble the Reader any farther in relating them.</p>

As to his Calling and Parents Holy Writ is altogether Silent, that he was brought up in Learning, and well skilled in the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, is not only the Opinion of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus,</hi> but ſeveral others. That he was the firſt that actually as a Diſciple followed our Lord, is certain; for although <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> were firſt called, yet they returned again to their Trades, continuing at them, for the ſpace of a year before they entered themſelves under his Banner: And now the Prophetick time being expired, at the end of which the Meſſiah was to come, he was looked for by moſt of the Jewiſh Rabbins; but they, through their miſunderſtanding, being blinded, as ſuppoſing he ſhould deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven attended with Hierarchies of Angels, did not imagine he could be ſhrouded under the diſguiſe of Fleſh and Blood; wherefore that he might work out the Redemption of Mankind, he rather choſe the mean and poorer ſort of Men than the Rich and Mighty.</p>

It was he likewiſe that deſired our Saviour <hi>to ſhew him the Father,</hi> and was reproved for his Ignorance in not underſtanding the foregoing words of his Lord and Maſter, who told him <hi>that he was the Image of his father; and that what he did was by his appointment, and that the Miracles that he had wrought were ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, that he was ſent by the Father.</hi>

years carried on the Great work of the Goſpel, he came at laſt to <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> a City in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where the People worſhipped a Dragon for their God by the name of <hi>Jupiter Ammon;</hi> which Blindneſs and Superſtitious Idolatry, ſo moved the Apoſtle to pity them, that he earneſtly put up his Prayers to Heaven, that that deluding Deity might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; which were ſoon Anſwered, and the Serpent and Fiend that continued for a long time before in it to give Anſwers to ſuch as came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing, vaniſhed, at leaſt the latter; and then he preached to them the way of Saving Knowledge, alledging that God had ſent his Son into the World to ſave Sinners, and that through his Blood only they muſt be waſhed from their ſins declaring the Goodneſs and infinite Mercy of God in ſo doing. Which ſo abaſhed many of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, that they were utterly aſhamed of the God they had formerly worſhipped, inſomuch that a great number of them were Converted to the Chriſtian Faith. So powerful was the Operation of the Holy Spirit, which put in with the preaching of that Apoſtle, to finiſh the work; upon which Satan perceiving his Kingdom to decay uſed all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to raiſe up a Perſecution, the which in the end God permitted, and by order of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the Apoſtle was ſeized and carried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and after his being Sentenced he was Cruelly ſcourged, and after that hanged by the neck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a pillar; though ſome would, have it, that he was Crucified, but however during the execution ſuch a terrible Earthquake happened that the Earth began to open ſo that the affrighted Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cryed to Heaven for Mercy, upon which it inſtantly ſtayed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57946:28"/>The Apoſtle being dead his body was taken down by St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> his Companion in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel at that time and <hi>Mariamne</hi> St. <hi>Philip's</hi> Siſter who bore him Company in all his Travels after they had taken him down they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently interr'd him, and when they had confirmed the People in the Faith of Chriſt, they departed thence.</p>
                  <p>That St. <hi>Philip</hi> was Married is generally affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not only by <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, who reckon him amongſt the number of the married Apoſtles, <hi>Polycrates</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> tells us that <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle ſuffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom at <hi>Hierapolis</hi> with two of his Daughters, who perſevered in their Virginity, and that a third died at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and was buried there: but ſome think he might be miſtaken and take <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon, who lived at <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> of whoſe Daughters we read in the Hiſtory of the Apoſtles; but of this no certainty: but it is obſerved by the Antients, that he was one of the Apoſtles that left no Sacred Writings behind him, the greater part of his Life (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> obſerves) being taken up and Employed in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, in Preaching and Inſtructing the Nations, having little time to write any books; or if he did, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they might be loſt either at the time of his Death, or afterward; and ſo failed of being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Poſterity. Though <hi>Epiphanius</hi> informs us that the Ghoſticks in former times produced a Goſpel giving it the name of St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Goſpel which they applyed to the patronizing of their pernicious Principles, and diabolick Practices; but the cheat was ſoon diſcovered, and the ſpecious Arguments they uſed to prove it his, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and Silenced.</p>

                  <p>SAcred Hiſtory failes not to Inform us, that St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was one of the Twelve Apoſtles; but takes no farther notice of him than the bare mention of his Name, probably by reaſon he lies concealed under ſome other name; inſomuch that the Antients think him to be the ſame Perſon with <hi>Nathanael:</hi> and what the rather induces them ſo to think, is by reaſon that in their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, as in St. <hi>John, Philip</hi> and <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael</hi> are joyned together, ſo in the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> So that it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but a miſtake might happen, either in the Original or Tranſlation, nor can it be imagined it was otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But this difficulty being either cleared or layed aſide, I ſhall proceed. Numbred amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles he was, and is ſaid to be by Birth an <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> But it is more likely that he was a <hi>Galilaean,</hi> and if he be the ſame Perſon with <hi>Nathanael,</hi> he muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be ſo, it being plain that he was of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee.</hi> But of what Calling or Tribe is not ſet down. He was brought to our Saviour by <hi>Philip,</hi> and being confirmed that he was the <hi>Meſſia,</hi> he followed him to the laſt; and having with the reſt received the Holy Ghoſt, he preached the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57946:29"/>
Goſpel powerfully and plainly to the <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, accompanying <hi>Philip</hi> for the moſt part, and as the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory makes mention, he went to the hither <hi>India,</hi> which moſt imagine was that part of it that lies towards <hi>Aſia,</hi> tho' <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us, it was the <hi>India</hi> bordering upon <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> which then muſt be the <hi>Aſian Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia;</hi> and <hi>Sophronius</hi> calls it the <hi>Happy India;</hi> and informs us, that he carried thither St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>'s Goſpel, which he there left behind him. But <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives us a fuller Relation, that when <hi>Pantanus</hi> a famous Philoſopher, but a Chriſtian, coming many years after into the <hi>Indies,</hi> he, amongſt the Chriſtians that he there found, had a ſight of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel written in Hebrew which was as they reported the Goſpel St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> left behind him, when he planted the Goſpel amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we find him at <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> a City in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where he had in all likelihood ſuffered with St. <hi>Philip,</hi> had not the Earthquake over-awed his Executioners, for certain it is he was at the ſame time bound to a Croſs, but when they ſaw that Divine Vengeance was ready to overtake them for their impious Rage againſt the Apoſtles, they unbound him and ſet him at Liberty; from whence, as ſome think he jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed to <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> for there, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, he preached the Goſpel, and Converted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Chriſtian Faith from whence he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Albanopolis</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Great, a place much given to Idolatrous Worſhip, from which whilſt he thought to reclaim them and Convert them to the true Religion, the Governour of the City cauſed him to be apprehended and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57946:29"/>
for endeavouring (as he alledged) to draw the People from their Obedience. His Sentence was to be Crucified; and when the day of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution came, he went chearfully to embrace his Death Comforting and Exhorting his Proſelytes <hi>to keep ſtedfaſt in the Faith and Doctrine that they had received, which was able to make them wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> and ſo continued to inſtruct them to the laſt moment of his Life. Several there are that affirm he was Crucified with his head downwards, and that he was fleyed alive, which cruel uſuage as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relateth was common in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>After his Death, his Body was removed to <hi>Darus</hi> a City in the Borders of <hi>Perſia;</hi> from thence to <hi>Liſparis,</hi> one of the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Cities; from thence to <hi>Benevent</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome.</hi> After his Death, a certain Sect of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks produced a Fabulous Goſpel under the Title of his name; but it was ſoon deſcryed to be a Cheat, and not only rejected as Apocryphical, but alſo layed aſide even by thoſe who had been the Forgers of the ſame.</p>

                  <head>The Life and Martyrdom of St. <hi>THOMAS</hi> the Apoſtle.</head>
                  <p>SAcred Writ makes not either mention of the Birth-place or Parents of this Apoſtle, but that he was a Jew is moſt certain. As for his Calling, if <hi>Metaphraſtus</hi> ſays right, he was a Fiſherman, as indeed the greateſt part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were; he having two Names, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Didymus,</hi> the latter we cannot but ſuppoſe might upon ſome occaſion be given him ſome time after his Circumciſion; the Jews not uſually receiving any more than one name at the performance of that Grand Ceremony. A man of Reſolution and Zeal he was, as we may Gheſs, for when the reſt of the Diſciples endeavoured to perſwade our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from going into <hi>Judaea,</hi> when he purpoſed to raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, objecting, that the Jews layed wait to ſtone him and putting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57946:31"/>
him in mind, how lately they had attempted it: But <hi>Thomas</hi> alone ſtood up, and admoniſhed them not to perſwade him from it, but ſaid, <hi>Let us alſo go that we may die with him,</hi> John 11.16. All that can be charged upon him, is his unaptneſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and want of a quick Apprehenſion readily to underſtand our Saviour's words, which ſome of the Fathers have rather attributed to a ſound Judgment and mature Deliberation, in not being over haſty to give Credit till he had fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and weighed what was ſaid; and for that purpoſe they quote St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who calls the <hi>Berae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> bleſſed becauſe they ſearched the Scriptures to ſee if thoſe things that were taught by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſo or no. But of his incredibility in not believing our Saviour's Reſurrection, after he had ſuch converſe with him, and ſeen ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles few can excuſe him. But in that point he was ſoon convinced of his Error, crying out <hi>my Lord and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bleſſed Jeſus being gone to Heaven <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the happy Manſions, he had promiſed whilſt on Earth, for thoſe that love and ſerve him.</hi> And this Apoſtle together with the reſt having received the Holy Ghoſt, uſed double diligence to obliterate what had been amiſs, for as 'tis ſaid, no ſooner had he received the powerful influence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, but he ſent <hi>Thaddaeus,</hi> one of the 70 Diſciples to <hi>Abgarus Toparch</hi> of <hi>Edeſſa</hi> (between whom and our Bleſſed Lord ſome Letters had paſſed, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> has it) to tell him what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things had happened and to admoniſh him to keep ſtedfaſt in the Faith he had received, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been Converted in our Saviour's time upon the Cure of a Malignant diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:57946:32"/>The Province that was aſſigned him, as <hi>Origen</hi> informes us was <hi>Parthia;</hi> but <hi>Sophronius</hi> tells us, that he preached the Goſpel to the <hi>Perſians, Medes, Carmans, Hyrcanians, Bactrians,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Countries adjacent. And it is recorded by an Antient Writer, that in <hi>Perſia</hi> he met the three Wiſe Men that came to make their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to our Saviour at his Birth; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had baptized them, he took them with him as his Fellow Labourers in the Goſpel; and then as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> has it, he went to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which muſt be meant of the <hi>Aſian Aethiopia,</hi> and, as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus</hi> farther adds, he having Travelled through thoſe Countries came at laſt to the <hi>Indies,</hi> but was afraid at firſt to venture himſelf amongſt ſuch Barbarous People, but being encouraged by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that gave full Aſſurance of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to be always with him, and to preſerve him from danger, he ſet forward and preached the Goſpel, as far as <hi>Taprobane,</hi> ſince called <hi>Suma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> and as he went Converted many of thoſe (in a manner) wild and ſavage People. Such is the powerful Operation of the Holy Spirit, that it can tame the Fierceſt; and give Saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the moſt Ignorant! There he ſhewed them the Follies and Idolatries they had blindly purſued; and that they inſtead of the true God, had worſhipped Images inſpired by Daemons, deſiring them at laſt to lay aſide their Idols, and embrace the Truth of Chriſtianity, by which means they ſhould not only be bleſſed whilſt upon Earth, but have Eternal Happineſs hereafter. By this and ſeveral convincing Miracles, he brought many over to the Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57946:32"/>And now becauſe that Eccleſiaſtick Hiſtory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us nothing further Memorable of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, I ſhall not think it amiſs to give the Reader a ſight of the Account the <hi>Portugals,</hi> upon their diſcovery of thoſe Countries, received from the Inhabitants, which is, that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> came firſt to <hi>Soccotora,</hi> an Iſland in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Sea, and from thence he departed to <hi>Cranganor,</hi> where having planted the Goſpel he went to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> where preaching in ſeveral Towns and Villages, at laſt he came to <hi>Malipur</hi> the chief City; and there, after having Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted many to the Faith, he went about to Found a Church for the Eſtabliſhing Divine Worſhip; but being forbidden by <hi>Sagamo,</hi> Prince of that Country, it ceaſed for ſome time: but the Apoſtle by his Miracles having Converted the Prince and a great part of his Nobility it was builded. Which ſo inraged the <hi>Brachamans</hi> or Heathen Prieſts, that they ſought alway to deſtroy the Apoſtle, as hoping by that means to extirpate his Doctrine, which by being embraced on all hands had near ſpoiled their Trade. So that one day when he was praying alone in a ſolitary place they came upon him with Stones, Darts and Spears; and after having grievouſly wounded him, one of them run him through the body with a Spear. After which his Body being taken up by his well-willers, it was Buried with great Solemnity in the Church that he had built, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards greatly inlarged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> in his book of the Glory of Martyrdom tells us of many Miracles that are done on the day of his Martyrdom; and one, if true, a perpetual one, which is a Lamp that burns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57946:33"/>
his Tomb without the help of Oyl, or any other combuſtible matter, and no Wind nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accident can extinguiſh it. Certain it is, that the <hi>Portugals</hi> at their firſt coming thither did find a ſort of Chriſtians in thoſe Countreys that went by the name of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Chriſtians; and that they had Churches of Divine Worſhip and lived up to the very ſtrictneſs of Religion; being governed by a Patriarch, and differing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little in their manney of worſhip from us.</p>
                  <p>A Story there is, that whilſt <hi>Don Alfons Souſa</hi> one of the firſt Vice-Roys in the <hi>Indies</hi> under <hi>John</hi> third King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> continued in thoſe parts a famous Croſs was found in St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Chappel with an Inſcription on it, which they compelled a Learned <hi>Bramin</hi> to Interpret, who gave it thus, that in the time of King <hi>Sagamo,</hi> one <hi>Thomas</hi> a Divine Perſon was ſent by the Son of God into thoſe Countries to inſtruct the People in the Knowledge of the true God; that he Builded a Church, and performed extraordinary Miracles, but at laſt, whilſt he was Kneeling at his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was by a <hi>Brachman</hi> thruſt through with a Spear, and that that Croſs ſtained with his Blood had been left as a memorial of what had happened. They farther add that another <hi>Bramin</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, interpreted it after the ſame manner, and ſo I ſhall leave it to the conſideration of the Reader, as a thing no ways impoſſible to bear the face of Truth, the matter of the Lamp excepted.</p>

                  <p>SOme Scruple there has been made about this Apoſtle; whether he that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls our Lords Brother, was the ſame with him that ſat Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was called <hi>James</hi> the Juſt. But ſeeing there is no mention of any <hi>James</hi> more than two in Scripture, that were Apoſtles, it will not be amiſs to take it for granted that there were no other than <hi>James</hi> the Great and <hi>James</hi> the Leſs, and that this Apoſtle was the ſame Perſon with <hi>James</hi> the Juſt, and then conſequently the ſame <hi>James</hi> that ſat Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and that which induces me the rather to believe it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Arguments that have been uſed to diſprove it, have not been admitted as reaſonable by the Antients.</p>

and there notwithſtanding St. <hi>Peter</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were preſent, he ſtood up and paſſed the Decretory Sentence, which render'd him greatly honoured by all the Apoſtles, who gave him precedency in ſuch a weighty Affair; which had St. <hi>Peter</hi> done, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would paſt doubt have Trumpeted it out as the main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his being the chief of all the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>In fine, he adminiſtred in his Province with Care and Diligence, omitting no part that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to his Miniſtry, that by his uprightneſs and unwearied endeavours he ſo calmed the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born <hi>Jews,</hi> that a great number not only of the vulgar ſort, but of thoſe of moſt eminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them adhered to his Doctrine. Yet there wanted not ſome Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> amongſt them to inveigh againſt him, and ſtir up the Multitude as they ſaw fit opportunity, and theſe were the Engines of the Scribes and Phariſees, even ſuch notorious Villains as they could hire, to promote miſchief. Theſe inſinuated into the multitude that the Apoſtle was a Perverter of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a ſtirer up to Rebellion; and that, if ſuch things were ſuffered, God would bring the <hi>Romans</hi> upon them to take away their Country.</p>
                  <p>That having ſpread their Infection abroad though to little purpoſe, they reſolved to try an other way, whereupon the Scribes and Phariſees (thoſe Maſters of miſchievous invention, and chief diſſemblers) came to the Apoſtle at the Feaſt of the Paſſover telling, that ſince the People were unſettled in their Opinions, they did not think it amiſs that he ſhould from a convenient place ſtand over the Temple porch, and exhort them to a ſtedfaſt belief of Chriſtianity; telling him that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57946:35"/>
for their parts they looked upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> as the true Meſſiah. To which the Apoſtle conſenting, when he was conveniently placed, they with a loud Voice made this following Addreſs to him, <hi>Tell us, O</hi> Juſtus, <hi>whom we have all the reaſon in the world to believe, That ſeeing the people are ſo generally led away with the doctrine of Jeſus that was crucified, tell us what is the Inſtitution of the crucified Jeſus.</hi> Whereunto the Apoſtle made anſwer with an audible Voice, ſaying, <hi>why do ye enquire of Jeſus the ſon of man, he ſits in Heaven on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, and will come again in the Clouds of Heaven.</hi> Which the People that were below no ſooner heard, but with a Loud ſhout they Glorified the bleſſed Jeſus, and proclaimed him with Hoſanna's. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Scribes and Phariſees ſeeing their Policy defeated, and that they had rather confirmed the People than any ways withdrawn them, it ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them, that thereupon they reſolved his death and crying out that <hi>Juſtus</hi> himſelf was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and become an Impoſtor; then took him up by force and threw him down from the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements: Notwithſtanding which fall he rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf upon his Knees and prayed for them, the which whilſt he was doing, ſuch Villains as they had appointed for that purpoſe fell upon him with Clubs and Stone till one amongſt the reſt (notwithſtanding the Intreaty of many to ſave his Life) with a Fuller's Club beat out his Brains, and by that means gave his Soul a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the <hi>Eternal Habitations of Bliſs and Joy that fade not away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He dyed in the 94 year of his Age, and 24 after Chriſts Aſcenſion to the grief of all good Men. <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tours</hi> informs us that he was

                  <head>The Life and Martyrdom of <hi>SIMON</hi> the Zelot, an Apostle.</head>
                  <p>THis Apoſtle, as moſt are apt to believe, was one of our Lord's Brothers; that is, Son to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who Eſpouſed the Bleſſed Virgin. Amongſt the Apoſtles he is ſtiled <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite,</hi> whence ſome Conjecture that he was born at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee;</hi> others take him to be the Bridegroom, at who's Wedding our Saviour <hi>turned water into wine.</hi> But this word has no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Country or Place, from whence he took his being, but from his hot and fiery Zeal; the word bearing ſuch a ſignification in the Hebrew. Nor do we imagine that he took that name from the ardent Affections he bore to his Maſter, but from ſome Sect that he was of, before he came to be our Saviour's Diſciple.</p>
                  <p>For the better explaining of which, note, that as there were many Sects and Diviſions amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo was there one called the Sect of the Zelots; a more devout ſort of men than the reſt, and of this Sect 'tis to be ſuppoſed he had that additional Name. Theſe ſort of men were indeed very troubleſome to the <hi>Jews,</hi> viz. the Sect of the Zelots, for as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and others, well noteth, they were the cauſe of the Dreadful Calamities that befell in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> during its being Beſieged by <hi>Titus, Veſpatian</hi>'s Son; but this is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57946:36"/>
upon the Apoſtle, no more than St. <hi>Paul's</hi> being a Phariſee, or St. <hi>Matthew</hi> a Publican.</p>
                  <p>When he came to his Apoſtolical Office, no more mention is made of him in Holy Writ, but that he continued with the Apoſtles, till they were diſperſed by the Perſecution the <hi>Jews</hi> raiſed againſt them; he then, paſt doubt, applying himſelf to the undertaking his charge: For as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> relates he departed for <hi>Aegypt;</hi> where having ſucceſsfully preached the Goſpel for ſome time, he departed thence for <hi>Cyrene,</hi> thence into <hi>Africa;</hi> though <hi>Baronius</hi> will not allow of that; making <hi>Peter</hi> the firſt Planter of Chriſtianity in thoſe Parts. But how far his Negative in that point may be credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let any conſider that underſtands. What he does in that caſe, is done to make his own Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions good in relation to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> for ſhould he own that any other of the Apoſtles had been there before <hi>Peter,</hi> he would confound himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But to let that paſs, we will grant that it is moſt likely that this St. <hi>Simon</hi> was not only in <hi>Africa,</hi> but in many other places, and that he having paſſed all along the Coaſt, Sailed over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Britain,</hi> for ſo many of the Ancients have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and that he preached the Goſpel here ſucceſsfully, inſtructing the rude and barbarous People in the way to everlaſting Life, and earneſtly endeavouring to turn them from their Idolatrous worſhip, working many Miracles, inſomuch that many embraced Chriſtianity; till at laſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that great Enemy of our Salvation ſtirred up the Multitude to perſecute him: whoſe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rage in a ſhort time after crowned him with Martyrdom, as not only <hi>Dorotheus</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> affirm, but alſo expreſſed in the Menologies where
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57946:37"/>
we are informed that St. <hi>Simon</hi> went at laſt into <hi>Britain,</hi> and having enlightned the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, he at length was Crucified by the Infidels, and buried there; but as to any particular place of his Burial, no mention is made.</p>
                  <p>Some there are who tell us, that after he had Preached the Goſpel in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he went to <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> where meeting with St. <hi>Jude,</hi> they jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed together into <hi>Perſia,</hi> where having planted the Goſpel, they were both Crowned with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. But this account is rejected by moſt of the Fathers, and <hi>Baronius</hi> is forced to confeſs that it is founded only upon a Book called the Paſſion of the Apoſtles; (an Author of no great Credit) and the reaſon of this variation is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be in the miſtake that has ariſen about the Perſon of St. <hi>Simon,</hi> for ſome will have <hi>Symeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> who was St. <hi>James</hi>'s Succeſſor in the See of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſame with this Apoſtle who was crucified in the 112 year of his Age under <hi>Trajan</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, but that by reaſon of the difference of years and the deſcription of both their Perſons under different Characters in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtory, render it altogether a groundleſs ſurmiſe.</p>

As for his Deſcent and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, he was one of the four that were called our Lord's Brothers, Son to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and Brother to St. <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that he was one of the Twelve Apoſtles is certain, being often numbred with them by the Evangeliſts; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the 14 Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, we find upon our Saviour's declaring to his Diſciples what great things he and his Father would do; and what glorious Manifeſtations he would make of his Power and Godhead, after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch of his Diſciples as perſevered in their Obedience. St. <hi>Jude</hi> (who looked for nothing leſs than a Temporal Kingdom of the Meſſiah, not thinking how that mean condition in which our Saviour continued in upon Earth, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Pomp and Magnificence that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected upon that occaſion) demanded of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>why he would manifeſt himſelf to his diſciples and not to the world?</hi> to which our Lord replyed, <hi>that the world was not capable of ſuch divine Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations as ſhould be revealed unto them.</hi>

the Apoſtle to <hi>Abgarus</hi> the Governour of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> which according to the Name is ſuppoſed to be this St. <hi>Jude,</hi> unleſs it might be another of the ſame name; for as we have it in another place, this <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> was one of the 70; and then it could not be St. <hi>Jude,</hi> for he was one of the 12 Apoſtles, as is before mentioned: but howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis certain that at his firſt ſetting out, he Preached the Goſpel in <hi>Judaea, Samaria, Galilee, Idumea,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adjacent; from thence he went into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> And <hi>Nicephorus</hi> tells us, that after all he came to <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> where <hi>Abgarus</hi> was Governour, and where the other <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> who was one of the 70 had been before him, and there perfected what was begun, and having by his Preaching and Miracles eſtabliſhed the Goſpel, he died a Peaceable and Quiet Death. But <hi>Dorotheus</hi> affirms that he was ſlain at <hi>Berytus,</hi> and Buried there in a ſtately Tomb, although by the General conſent of the Latin Church he went Preaching the Goſpel in <hi>Perſia,</hi> where after he had brought many over to the Faith, and eſtabliſhed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion there for many years, he at laſt was, for his reproving and ſtrongly oppoſing Idolatrous and diabolick Devices of the Magi, by their procurement cruelly put to death.</p>
                  <p>That he was married and had Children appears by the ſequel. <hi>Domitian</hi> the bloody Emperour being jealous of his long continuance in the State of Empire, upon notice had that there remained ſome Perſons of the Line of <hi>David,</hi> he ordered them to be brought before him, viz. two young men, who were the Grand Sons of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and Kinſmen to our Lord; when they were come into

                  <head>The Life and Martyrdom of St. <hi>MATTHIAS</hi> the Apoſtle.</head>
                  <p>ALthough St. <hi>Matthias</hi> was not immediately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Lord as one of the Diſciples, yet it is ſuppoſed that he was all along an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon the Miniſtry, as being one of the 70; but a way being made for him by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy of <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> (that Son of Perdition) he was afterwards numbered amongſt the 12, and called to be an Apoſtle. For upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the reſt that ſince <hi>Judas</hi> was fallen off, it was but neceſſary that another ſhould ſupply his place, whereupon they pitched upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> as a very fit Perſon for to undertake ſo Sacred an Employment; which he as joyfully embraces, when the Lot fell upon him.</p>
                  <p>Not long after which, he with the reſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt, he betook himſelf to the Province that was allotted him; and firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel in <hi>Judaea,</hi> where indeed moſt of the Apoſtles began to <hi>proclaim the glad tidings of Salvation to Mankind.</hi> He then paſſed on to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where it is reported, but with what credit I know not, that the Gentiles, to try his Sanctity, gave him a cup of intoxicated Wine, who in the Name of Jeſus drank it off without doing him the leaſt harm, and that he cured about 50 Perſons who had been poiſoned with the ſame intoxicated Potion, and by laying his hands on them reſtored them to their ſight; of which the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57946:39"/>
operation of the Poiſon had deprived them. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> tells us that he came into the firſt <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi> But <hi>Sophronius</hi> ſays the ſecond, though perhaps they may be both miſtaken for <hi>Cappadocia</hi> his Principal place of abode being ſeated near to the Irruption of the River <hi>Apſarus</hi> and the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Hus,</hi> both belonging to that Country, nor is any <hi>Aethiopia</hi> nearer that place on the ſide he was ſaid to return, but however the place where he came was very Barbarous, as may appear by his uſage, for happening amongſt people of a fierce, rough and untractable nature, paſſing all bounds of Hoſpitality and common Civility, he was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all manner of Rudeneſs and Inhumanity; from whom for all his Pains and Labour taken about ſaving their immortal Soul, and directing them in the way to everlaſting Life, he was at laſt Martyred by them, <hi>Anno Chriſto</hi> 59. Or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will have it, 64; but as to the manner of his Death, it is uncertain, though <hi>Dorotheus</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, he was Martyred at <hi>Sebeſtople,</hi> near the Temple of the Sun (paſt doubt for reproving their Idolatrous worſhip, in <hi>Adoring the Creature inſtead of the Creator</hi>) and that he was buried there. Another account we have, that he was ſeiſed by the Jews, as a Blaſphemer; and after being ſtoned he was beheaded. When as the Greek Offices ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by ſeveral Breviaries, Relate that he was hanged upon a Croſs; and farther, it is ſaid, that his Body was for a long time kept at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and conveyed thence to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Helen</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, where ſome Bones, ſaid to be his, are ſhewed with great Veneration to this day, though others affirm that his remains are at <hi>Trier</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> about which ſome diſputes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57946:40"/>
have been held, but to little purpoſe, for it is to be ſuppoſed, they have him both alike. His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is Celebrated in the Greek Church on the 9th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> unleſs lately layed aſide by reaſon of the overſpreading of Paganiſme in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of great Courage, and well skilled in the Jewiſh or <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, being, as many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients imagine, of a Noble Stock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amongſt many Apocriphal Writings attributed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, there was a Goſpel publiſhed under the Patronage of his name, which is mentioned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and others, and condemned with the reſt by <hi>Gelaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> it having been before rejected by others. Under his Name alſo were publiſhed Traditions, cited by <hi>Clemens of Alexandria,</hi> from whence, paſt doubt, the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſaying of his, which they abuſed to ſo vile a purpoſe, under the Patronage of his Name.

                  <p>THis Evangeliſt bearing a <hi>Roman</hi> Name, is thought to receive it either upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome Employment, or for that he aſſumed it when he travelled into the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces; which was uſual with the Jews.

bowing to Stocks and Stones, telling them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that unleſs they turned to God and repented with their whole hearts, they would be eternally miſerable.</hi> Upon which Satan fearing the overthrow of his Kingdom, bent all his Malice to ſtir up the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deſtroy the Evangeliſt: when it being the time of Eaſter, at what time the great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <hi>Serapis,</hi> one of their reputed gods happening to be Celebrated: Whilſt St. <hi>Mark</hi> was intent at Divine Worſhip, the Barbarous Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude broke in upon him, and faſtening Cords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Feet dragged him through the Streets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

did he deſert him in any of his troubles, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proved a ſteady and faithful Friend and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. He it was that wrote the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and there we find him all along; when he is ſpeaking of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſpeaks all of himſelf which could not be unleſs he was preſent with him; nor is it at all to be queſtioned that he was with him at <hi>Rome</hi> in his Confinement, nor that he carried Meſſages from the Apoſtle to the Churches to ſtrengthen and ſupport them, moſt of the Fathers being of Opinion, that it was meant of our Evangeliſt, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions theſe words, <hi>the Beloved brother whoſe praiſe is in the Goſpel throughout all the Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it in all likelyhood probable that he left the Apoſtle, till Death made a fatal (though in one ſence happy) ſeparation, by Crowning him with Martyrdom; though <hi>Metaphraſtus</hi> would have it, that he left St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Preach the Goſpel in <hi>Aegypt, Lybia</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſtern Countries, and that there by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, and powerful Preaching, he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted a great number to the Faith; ſettling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion under a ſet form and order by Inſtituting Guides and Paſtors to Inſtruct and Confirm the People in his Abſence, and that he himſelf was Biſhop of <hi>Thebais.</hi> But on the Contrary, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> tells us that he preached the Goſpel in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Galatia</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and that from thence he went into <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where he run many great hazards of his Life, by reaſon that in many places the inveterate Jews ſtirred up the People to ſtone him, yet he undauntedly perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his teaching all men the way to Saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; untill at laſt the Devil ſo far inſpired ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Barbarous Villains with Malice and Revenge as to deſtroy the Holy Man; but as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and place of his death the conteſt amongſt the Antients is not fully decided to this day, ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that he dyed in <hi>Egypt;</hi> Others in <hi>Greece</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology will have it in <hi>Bythinia.</hi> And <hi>Dorotheus</hi> contradicting him, will have it at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> ſome again there are, that ſay he died a Natural Death. But <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> with ſome others, poſitively affirm that he received the Crown of Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>Of which <hi>Nicephorus</hi> gives us this following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>viz.</hi> that St. <hi>Luke</hi> coming into <hi>Greece,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully Preached the Goſpel, Baptizing many Converts into the Chriſtian Faith, and working many Miracles; till at laſt a Party of Infidels (encouraged by their Preiſts, whoſe Idolatrous Worſhip the Evangeliſt ſharply reproved) fell at unawares upon him, and forcibly dragged him to the Place of Execution, where not having a Croſs in readineſs, they hanged him upon an Olive Tree, in the Eightieth year of his Age, or as St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> has it, in the Eighty fourth.</p>
                  <p>Now contrary to this, <hi>Kirſtenus</hi> having taken it from an Antient <hi>Arabick</hi> Author, tells us, that he ſuffered Martyrdom at <hi>Rome,</hi> which might perhaps be after St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt impriſoment there, and his departure from that City, when probably St. <hi>Luke</hi> was left behind as his Subſtitute or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſtrengthen and confirm the Brethren in his Abſence, and ſo might ſuffer in the General Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution under <hi>Nero;</hi> and the main Reaſon that has induced many to give more than ordinary Credit to this Relation, is, becauſe he no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57946:43"/>
his Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles: for had he out-lived <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> he would, paſt doubt, have recorded ſo remarkable a Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their Martyrdoms, and have given a larger Account of the ſtate of the Church. But certain it is that he was put to Death. Nor are ſome wanting who affirm that his Body was at the Command of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, or his Son <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> brought to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and there ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly interred in the Great Church, Founded there to the Honour of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>That he was not only a man of great Learning, but alſo, more than ordinary, inſpired by the Holy Spirit; his two Books, <hi>viz.</hi> his Goſpel, and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles teſtifie: In the former he ſets down the Life of our Saviour, and many of his glorious Works and Actions, from the time of his Birth, till the time of his glorious Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; though, as many Believe, he never ſaw our Saviour, or at moſt had little or no Converſe with him. As for his ſecond Book, we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he took great pains to Travel with the Apoſtles, eſpecially with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as I have before recited, that by that means he might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to give a faithful Account of their Actions, that ſo he might Record them for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Church in all Ages. And thus much for the Glorious Life and Death of this bleſſed Evangeliſt, <hi>whoſe praiſe is in the Goſpel,</hi> and his immortal Soul ſinging <hi>Halelujahs before the Throne of the Lamb, who liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I ſhall conclude the Holy Lives and Victorious Deaths of the Ever bleſſed Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, who all of them (St. <hi>John</hi> excepted)

                  <p>HAving run through the Lives of the Bleſſed Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give the Reader a view of ſuch Worthies, who, next to them, fought ſucceſsfully under the Victorious Banner of our great <hi>Captain, the Lord Jeſus, and through him became more than Conquerors.</hi> And firſt I ſhall begin with St. <hi>Ignatius;</hi> but leſt any at firſt view ſhould think him to be the Popiſh <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which Founded the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> theſe are to ſatisfie, that this <hi>Ignatius</hi> was Born, nay ſuffered Martyrdom ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before Popery was known, and above a thouſand years e're the deſtructive Order of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had Being. But to my purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as himſelf teſtifies, was born 12 years before the Crucifixion of our Saviour, he having with his proper Eyes beheld him in the Fleſh; he being, as many think, one of thoſe little ones that our Saviour commanded his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to ſuffer for to come unto him, nay ſome go farther, and affirm, that it was he whom our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord ſet in the midſt of his Diſciples, when they contended one with another about Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Precedency. However he was indued with a more than ordinary Portion of the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> and ſucceeded St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Paſtorſhip or Government of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he laboured diligently in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57946:45"/>
Converting and Confirming many to and in the Chriſtian Faith, being a great oppoſer of the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> or Erroneous Opinions that had ſprung up in the Church. But the Devil, that Enemy of the Goſpel ſoon plotted his deſtruction; for <hi>Trajan</hi> returning from the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, commanded a Gratulatory Sacrifice to be offered to his gods in every City, for the Victory he had obtained; and at his coming to <hi>Antioch, Ignatius</hi> was required to be preſent and aſſiſting at the Sacrifice, by ſuch as willed his deſtruction, they thinking they could not have a fairer opportunity to work his Ruin. But he utterly refuſing ſuch a deteſtable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was brought before the Emperour, where to his Face he did not only deny ſo to do, but ſharply reproved him for his Idolatry, <hi>worſhipping falſe Gods, and Images made with hands:</hi> Upon which the Emperour in a Rage commanded that a Guard of Soudiers ſhould carry him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there to caſt him in Priſon till his Arrival.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he was carried by ſhort Journies through <hi>Aſia,</hi> but in his way he was no whit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his Charge, for as he went, ſtrictly Guarded, he Preached the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Confirmed a great number that were wavering; as likewiſe ſtrictly charged them to beware of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and endeavour to extirpate it, which <hi>elſe like Tares would greatly annoy the Churches wheat:</hi> ſending ſeveral Epiſtles to the Churches, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring them to continue ſtedfaſt and put their truſt in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where <hi>Polycarp</hi> was Biſhop, he wrote an Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> directing it to <hi>Oneſimus</hi> their Paſtor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to have a care of Chriſt's Flock, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57946:45"/>
like a good Shepherd diligently feed them with the ſpiritual Food of the Everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>which is able to make men wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> as alſo another to the Church of <hi>Magneſia,</hi> which he directed to <hi>Dama</hi> their Biſhop, another likewiſe he wrote to <hi>Polybius,</hi> Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Trallis;</hi> with which he ſent an Exhortation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to be Courageous, and not to decline the Crown of Martyrdom, if offered; putting him in mind of the Sufferings of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, and of the Joy he was to receive if he continued <hi>faithful to the end:</hi> telling them of his cruel uſage in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> and how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he was to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake; Concluding with theſe words, <hi>Let Fire, Croſs, breaking of Bones, quartering my Members, cruſhing my Body, or all the torments that Men and Devils can invent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me, ſo that I may but enjoy my Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Rome</hi> he wrote to <hi>Policarp,</hi> a godly Paſtor, to take into his Care and Charge the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whilſt he could Elect a fit Perſon to be Biſhop in his Room; whereby he proved himſelf to be a juſt and ſincere man, who even in death was mindful of his Flock.</p>
                  <p>When the day of his Martyrdom came, he chearfully ſaid, <hi>I am God's Corn, when the wild Beaſts have ground me to powder with their teeth I ſhall be his white bread.</hi> He ſuffered Martyrdom the 11th. year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> being, as many of the Antients affirm, Torn to pieces by wild Beaſts in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre to make the Tyrant ſport. And thus ended the Life of this good Man, who upon many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was wont to ſay, <hi>Amor meus Crucifixus eſt;</hi> My Love is Crucified, meaning either Chriſt the Object of his Love, or that his darling Sins and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57946:46"/>
Affections to the World were Crucified; and in another place he declares that he beheld the Lord after his Reſurrection before he Aſcended.</p>

                  <p>THis <hi>Polycarp</hi> was Diſciple to St. <hi>John,</hi> when on a time going with St. <hi>John</hi> to the Bath, and obſerving <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretick there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he cryed out, <hi>Let us ſpeedily hence, for fear that the Bath, wherein our Lord's Adverſary is, do fall upon our heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had for many years taught his Flock, inſtructing and confirming them in the way to Eternal Life, the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> that dwelt at <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> went to the <hi>Roman</hi> Proconſul and grievouſly complained that the Biſhop went about to pervert the People, and to raiſe up Innovation, which would prove deſtructive to the Empire, if not in time reſtrained. Whereupon Order was given for the apprehending him, when at the earneſt entreaty of the Chriſtians he retired to an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Village; but the Purſuers upon notice of his being their came after him at full Cry, of which he being informed, removed thence to another Village, ſome diſtance thence.</p>
                  <p>When the mad multitude having ſought long
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57946:46"/>
in vain. In the firſt Village they purſued him to the ſecond, and there apprehending two Boys, they ſcourged them ſo cruelly that one of them confeſſed where the Holy Man lay, and directed them to his Lodging; from whence although he might have eſcaped their hands, he refuſed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>the will of the Lord be fulfilled,</hi> when they had beſet the houſe he came down to them, and told them he was the man they ſought, when behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Gravity and Chearful Countenance many repented that they had employed themſelves in ſo ill a work, wiſhing that they had never undertaken it. After a while he invited them in, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meat to be ſet before them, only requeſting the favour to have an hours time to Pray in private; the which they granted: the fervency of whoſe Prayers being heard by many of his Perſecutors, they could not abſtain from weeping, and were forced to confeſs he was a good man.</p>
                  <p>Now the Night before the Morning he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, he had a Viſion, and therein he thought <hi>the Pillow that was under his head was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to Aſhes,</hi> with which he acquainted ſeveral of his Friends, and from thence Prognoſticated that his Life was almoſt at a period.</p>
                  <p>After he had prayed, he came to thoſe that were to carry him before the Proconſul, who ſet him upon an Aſs, and ſo brought him to <hi>Smyrna;</hi> where he arriving, (upon the ſolemn Feaſt day) was met by <hi>Herod</hi> and his father <hi>Nicetes,</hi> who were Rulers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Proconſul; the former of which greeting him kindly, took him up into his Coach or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and began to commune with him after this manner, What will it injure you, or what harm is it to ſay, <hi>Lord Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>to Sacrifice and be ſaved?</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57946:47"/>
To which he meekly replyed, <hi>I will not, neither dare I do according to your Counſel.</hi> From which, and ſeveral other Speeches of the Holy Man, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> gathering that he could not work upon him by fair means, he began to threaten him, and at laſt tumbled him out of his Chariot; which he took with exceeding Patience, when, as it is recorded in ſome of his Epiſtles, a Voice was heard from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Be of good cheer, O</hi> Polycarp, <hi>and play the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he came before the Proconſul, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether he was that <hi>Polycarp</hi> of which he had heard ſuch complaints? but beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to deny that he was the man; but when he ſaw he would not deny himſelf, he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to tender his ſafety, and have regard unto his Age, ſaying, <hi>Swear by the Fortune of</hi> Caeſar, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of what is past, and ſay, Remove the wicked.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>Polycarp,</hi> looking ſtedfaſtly upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers ſaid, <hi>Remove theſe wicked.</hi> But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Proconſul urged him again, ſaying, <hi>Swear and I will let thee go; Blaſpheme and defie Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſafe.</hi> To which the good Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>fourſcore and ſix years have I ſerved Chriſt, neither hath he ever offended me at any time, and how then can I revile my King that has thus preſerved me.</hi> The Proconſul urged him again to ſwear by <hi>the Fortune of</hi> Caeſar. To which he replyed, <hi>that the Chriſtian Religion taught Obedience to all Governours, but to ſwear by his Fortune out of vain-glory he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed.</hi> Upon which he threatned him with wild Beaſts, Fire, and other Torments; but he ſtood reſolute in his Faith, ſaying, <hi>You threaten me with Fire which ſhall laſt but an hour, and is quickly quenched, but you are ignorant of the everlaſting fire at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57946:47"/>
the day of Judgment and of thoſe endleſs torments which are reſerved for the wicked; but why delay you? appoint me to what death you pleaſe.</hi> Which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul hearing was amazed at his Courage, and commanded the Cryer to Proclaim thrice in the midſt of the Theatre, that <hi>Polycarp was a Chriſtian.</hi> But this not at all appeaſed his Enemies, who thirſted after nothing more than his Blood, and thereupon deſired the Proconſul that he might be thrown to the Beaſts; but he alledging the time for the Game of Beaſts was paſt, they prayed that he might be expoſed to the flames to which laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and thereupon the multitude led him away, Crying, <hi>this is that Doctor of</hi> Aſia, <hi>the Father of the Chriſtians, the overthrower of our Gods, who hath taught many, that our Gods are not to be Adored.</hi> Every one of them fetching wood from their Shops and Houſes.</p>
                  <p>When the Pile was reared, the Holy Man put of his Apparel being aſſiſted therein by the Faithful Chriſtians, that came to take their laſt Farewel all of him, ſtriving to touch his Body, as accounting it no ſmall Honour. When he was naked, the Infidels offered to nail him to the Stake; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to forbear, ſaying, <hi>Suffer me even as I am, for he that has given me ſtrength to come to this Fire, will give me patience likewiſe to perſevere therein, without your faſtening me with Nailes.</hi> Upon which he put up his Prayers to Heaven, with great Fervency giving all Laud and Praiſe to God, that he had been pleaſed to bring him to ſuch a glorious End, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he knew that he accounted him worthy to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for his Names ſake.</p>
                  <p>When he had ended his Prayer, the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors kindled the Fire, the which though raged

Yet the Malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther, for they, not content with his death, ſtirred up <hi>Nicetes</hi> to move the Proconſul not to deliver his Body to the Chriſtians, leaſt (ſaid they) <hi>they ſhould forſake the worſhiping of Jeſus and worſhip him.</hi> Whereupon the Proconſul ordered it ſhould be Conſumed to Aſhes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>TErtullian</hi> was by Birth a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of Noble Parentage, his Father being a Centurion of the Proconſular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; an Office in great eſteem amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> He in his youth gave himſelf wholly to ſtudy and attained to ſuch Perfection, that he was admired by all men, his Praiſe being left upon Record by many of our Modern Divines.</p>
                  <p>At his firſt entry upon Chriſtianity he was made a Presbyter; in which ſtate he continued teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing ſuch as he could, in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, till about the middle of his Age, being a great oppoſer of the Sects of Hereticks, which then began to ſwarm in moſt Countries where the Goſpel had been planted. He living in the Perſecution under <hi>Severus,</hi> was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Chriſtians from ſuch as ſought their Lives, not only by his Arguments even to the Convincing of their Adverſaries, but alſo by protecting them from their Rage and Malice, and by his Godly perſwaſions ſo wrought upon the Emperour, that he was contented to ſtay the Perſecution for a time, during which interview he wrote ſeveral excellent Books againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; ſome of which are extant to this day, and eſpecially that, <hi>De Corona Militis,</hi> which he wrote upon the occaſion of a Chriſtian Soldier's refuſing to wear a Lawrel Crown upon his head, in Token of Victory; alledging, that it did not

become Chriſtians to wear Crowns in this Life. His manner was to pray thrice a day.</p>
                  <p>In his Writings about Death, Judgment, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, he tells us that when he was a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then he ſcoffed at thoſe things that he now prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and that therefore he did perceive that we were not born but made Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>His Converſion grew by Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and duly weighing them; declaring that whatever was done was in them foretold; and after his Converſion he was taken up Night and Day in Reading and Expounding them; getting them for the moſt part by heart, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his great Learning, he at laſt fell into a Relapſe by adhereing to the Doctrine of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus;</hi> which greatly Eclipſed the Glory of his former Life.

                     <hi>ORigen</hi> was Born of Chriſtian Parents, <hi>Anno</hi> 189 being Son to <hi>Leonides</hi> who trained him up in all good Literature, and ſo well inſtructed him in the grounds of Chriſtianity, that he in a ſhort time was too hard for his Teacher; at which his Father inwardly rejoyced, though he outwardly ſeemed diſpleaſed, and would often whilſt he was ſleeping kiſs his naked breſt, <hi>as the Temple wherein the Holy Ghoſt had choſen to dwell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt he was yet a youth the ſtorm of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution grew loud againſt the Church, by which his Father was taken from him and carried to Priſon, whom he would have followed at the peril of his own Life, had not his Mother, by hiding his Cloathes, reſtrained him; yet he writ to him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly admoniſhing him to continue faithful unto the end, and not alter his opinion, as indeed he did, being put to death for Chriſts ſake, and had all his Goods confiſcated. Whereupon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being left to ſhift for him and his Brother, they for a while ſuffered extream penury; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he was obliged to maintain himſelf by keeping a School, where he at leaſure hours great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved his ſtudies; when a while after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſo ordered it, that both he and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, together with his Brother, were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Houſe of a rich Matron, whereat his coming he found one <hi>Paulus</hi> a Heretick, who by his courteous demean had gained great repute,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57946:53"/>
not only with the Lady but with many others who frequented his Lectures. Yet <hi>Origen</hi> all that in him lay ſhunned his Company, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be perſwaded to joyn with him in Prayer, his daily buſineſs at ſpare times was to viſit ſuch as were impriſoned for the Faith, to Inſtruct, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Releive them; and uſually followed them to the place of Execution, though he greatly endangered himſelf thereby: Being once carried in order to be ſtoned to death, but God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly delivered him from the hands of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then multitude, and prevented their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Nay, ſo extreamly was he hated by the adverſaries of the Church, that oftentimes a Guard of Souldiers were obliged to watch the Houſe where he was for his ſafety.</p>
                  <p>He along time continued at the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned houſe, Preaching to, and Exhorting thoſe that came to him. A number daily reſorting, not only of men, but Women and Virgins; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which to avoid Temptation he Gelded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as miſapplying the Text wherein 'tis ſaid, <hi>There are ſome that make themſelves Eunuches for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> for which raſh Act of his he was afterwards upbraided by his Fellows.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Church of <hi>Achaia,</hi> being much vexed by the Hereticks, <hi>Origen</hi> was ſent thither by the Brethren, with Letters which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him to be aſſiſting to extirpate the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and make up the diſcord that was happened. When in his Journy he was by the Biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> made a Presbyter, when he was arrived there he grew ſo famous, that not only the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but the Heathens came far and near to hear him Preach, which ſo much Eclipſed the

fame of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Biſhop, that he ſtrove by all means to diſgrace him; and thereupon publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral ſcandals of him to the World, and amongſt the reſt that of gelding himſelf. Yet the Holy man like the Palm-tree, the more he was oppreſſed the more he grew, continuing to Preach in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> where <hi>Mammaea</hi> the Emperours Mother hearing of his fame, ſent for him, and by his Inſtructions was confirmed in the Faith. He it was that reclaimed St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> from his Haeretical opinions.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is that he ſuffered many great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions during the Perſecutions, as Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Racking with Iron bars, Confinement in Dungeons and the like; with many terrible threats of death, when at laſt hearing that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Chriſtians were carried to the Temple of an Idol in <hi>Alexandria</hi> to burn Incenſe, he ran thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and earneſtly exhorted them rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death than conſent to ſuch a wickedneſs; where he was no ſooner arrived, but the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude let go thoſe they had brought thither, and laying hold of him they haled him to the Altar, and there propoſed, that he would either offer Incenſe to the Idol, or defile his Body with an ugly Black-more; whereupon being in a great ſtraight they forced the Cenſer into his hands, and whilſt he trembling held it, they in the like manner obliged him to caſt the Incenſe into the fire; upon which they all bawled out, <hi>Origen has Sacrificed, Origen has Sacrificed,</hi> upon which the Church Excommunicated him, which ſo much grieved him, that had he not been ſupported by the Divine Spirit he had fallen into deſpair. A long time he mourned in ſilence and much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57946:54"/>
what he had done though unwillingly, many of his Prayers and Lamentations being yet extant though too tedious to be here inſerted.</p>
                  <p>After he had continued thus penitent a long he was again received into favour and whilſt he continued at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a Meſſenger came from the Governour of <hi>Arabia</hi> with Letters to the Leiutenant of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to haſten him thither, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Governour in ſeveral particulars of which he ſtood much in doubt; whether he was immediately diſpatched, and ſo confirmed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour that he gave him many rich preſents, there likewiſe he Inſtructed many, Converting the Infidels, and Confuting the Hereticks, who taught <hi>that the Souls and Body dyed together, and ſo at the laſt day would riſe together.</hi> There likewiſe <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Athenodorus</hi> became his Diſciples, and gained ſo much under him, that ſhortly after they were made Biſhops. And now the Church began to have reſt, but her Capital Enemy was Idle, but ploting all ways imaginable to diſturb her peace, inſomuch that <hi>Decius</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Philip</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he raiſed up another Perſecution. In which amongſt the reſt, <hi>Origen</hi> ſuffered many great afflictions, as Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rackings, Scourgings at Iron-ſtakes, dark noiſome Dungeons; and his feet for ſome days ſtretched two yards aſunder in the ſtocks, all which he patiently ſuffered for the ſake of his Bleſſed Maſter, who had ſhed his precious Blood to purchaſe his Redemption, that ſo he might follow him <hi>to thoſe eternal Manſions he went before to prepare, for all that faithfully love and ſerve him,</hi> nor can it be imagined that this great Pillar of the Church, came any whit ſhort of his bleſſed expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                  <p>By his conſtancy in oppoſing the Enemies of the Church, and his undaunted Reſolution, in carrying on the great work of the Goſpel, he grew in a ſhort time famous amongſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, inſomuch that he was made Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and had the governance of all the Churches in <hi>Africk;</hi> for nothing of any moment was done without his Knowledge and Conſent.

Yet could he not reſt quiet, for <hi>Arius</hi> and his Faction daily ſought his deſtruction; whereupon they charged him for breaking the Chalice; and that one <hi>Arſenius</hi> being murthered, he had cut off one of his Armes to practiſe Magick withal; and that he had lain with a Woman by force.

He ſaid, he did believe all; meaning all that he had written. But not long after Heavens Vengeance found him out, for he going into a Privy, there voided his Bowels, and died in that miſerable Condition.</p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> his Son <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſucceeding him, the Faction ſo far prevailed with him as to gain him to their Party, and then all of the Orthodox Religion went to wrack.

The Biſhops of the True Religion were Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Depoſed and Maſſacred; ſo that now all places were again filled with Lamentation and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was forced to fly from place to place to ſecure his Life: till at laſt it pleaſed God to move the Emperour to take him into

favour, and reſtore him to his Biſhoprick; which fore grieved his Enemies, who again began to lay grievous Accuſations to his Charge, and offered to prove them, but being urged thereto they could not do it.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Julian</hi> came to be Emperour, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Arians</hi> he ſent to the Governour of <hi>Egypt</hi> to Baniſh <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> but he only hid him till the Death of that wicked Emperour, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him at his own Charge.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He was a man of ſound Judgment, of great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Uprightneſs; much beloved of all good Chriſtians, which was ſeen by the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing they made at his Re-inſtallment.</p>

                  <p>ST. <hi>Baſil</hi> was born in <hi>Pontus,</hi> of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; his Great Grandfather ſuffering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Galerius Maximus.</hi> When this Holy Man was grown to years of diſcretion, he went to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> a City in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> where he profited much in Learning, excelling in a ſhort time all of his Age. When he had continued there for ſome time, he departed to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; from thence to <hi>Athens,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Antioch;</hi> in which places he greatly Improved his Learning; often diſputing and confounding the <hi>Arians,</hi> who in his time great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed. His Fame being once ſpread abroad, he was ordained Deacon by <hi>Meletius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> by the Deceaſe of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Predeceſſor.</p>
                  <p>He had not long been ſettled in that See before the Emperour <hi>Valence,</hi> by the perſwaſion of the <hi>Arians</hi> (whoſe Opinions he ſtrictly Embraced) was prevailed with to remove him, and put one of their Faction in his room, but when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was on his way, news came that his only Son was even at the point Death, which cauſed his ſtay: as likewiſe his Wife diſſwaded him from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by telling him of ſeveral fearful Dreams, that had preſented themſelves to her Fancy, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all had happened through his perſecuting the Chriſtians. Whereupon he ſent for <hi>Baſil,</hi> who coming into his Preſence, he ſpeaks to him after this manner, <hi>If thy Faith and Opinion be true, pray
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57946:60"/>
that my Son dye not of this diſeaſe.</hi> To which <hi>Baſil</hi> replyed, <hi>If thou wilt promiſe me to believe as I do, and if thou wilt bring the Church into <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Concord, paſt doubt thy child ſhall recover.</hi> But upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's refuſing to conſent, he departed; ſaying, <hi>Let God deal with the child as to him beſt ſeemeth and immediately after he died.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the perſecution raiſed by this Emperor he put 80 Presbyters into a Ship deſigning to ſet it on Fire upon the water; when meeting with <hi>Baſil,</hi> he perſwaded him to embrace the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine, promiſing to promote him to great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but he undauntedly told him, that <hi>ſuch fair Promiſes were fit only to intice Children, but that he was taught and nouriſhed by the Holy Scripture and was ready rather to ſuffer a thouſand deaths, than to ſuffer one ſyllable or Iota of the Scriptures to be altered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Emperour fell into a Rage, threatning to put him to Death and Confiſcate his goods: but he nothing daunted, replyed, <hi>he feared not what he could do to him for that if he put him do death it was only to ſet him at Liberty.</hi> The Praefect ſtanding by and hearing his reſolution, told him <hi>he was mad;</hi> to whom he replyed, <hi>I wiſh I may be for ever thus mad.</hi> Whereupon he had a nights time allowed him to reſolve what was beſt to be done.</p>
                  <p>Next Morning, he Preaching in the Church, the Emperour came in with an intent to diſturb him; but beholding the Gravity of the man, and his modeſt Behaviour, he recanted his purpoſe, and would have preſented him with a large Gift; but he mildly refuſed it. A while after the Praefect ſending for him, Commanded him to comply with the will of the Emperour, or there was no way for him but death. Yet gave him a longer time to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57946:61"/>
conſider, but in vain; for he grew yet more and more confirmed, deſiring rather to receive the Crown of Martyrdom, than to dye a natural Death: which when the Emperour perceived he revoked his Sentence: Yet at the Inſtance of the <hi>Arians,</hi> he conſented to ſubſcribe an Edict for his Baniſhment; but when he came to write, the Ink would make no impreſſion, though often tryed; as alſo at that time ſuch a Trembling ſeiſed his right hand, that being terrified he tore the Paper and caſt it from him. So that notwithſtanding all the malice of his Enemies, <hi>Baſil</hi> died at <hi>Caſarea,</hi> when he had ſat Biſhop there 8 years, departing this Life, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 370.</p>

                  <p>During <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s Reign, in the Eaſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire a great Sedition befell in the City of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica</hi>

                  <p>When <hi>Eugenius</hi> was Emperour, <hi>Flavianus</hi> the Prefect deſired leave of him to build an Altar of victory in the City of <hi>Millain,</hi> the which St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> greatly oppoſed, but perceiving he could not hinder it, he departed the City and returned not till after the death of the Emperour, and his Prefect, who going out to fight againſt <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi>

During his Solitude, he learned moſt of the Scripture by Heart, and not only ſo but he made many excellent Expoſitions upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and eſpecially that of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> ſometimes he would walk out of his Cell to viſit ſome of the Neighbouring Monks, who had betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a retired Life, living there truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, their Lives and Manners far differing from any of our Age.</p>
                  <p>After he had continued in this ſtate for ſome Years, he heard there were new differences ſprung up in the Church, whereupon he left his Cell and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; but all men judged St. <hi>Hierome</hi> the fitteſt perſon to ſucceed <hi>Damaſus</hi> the preſent Biſhop. Yet ſome there wanted not, who not long after began to Envy his Vertues, charging him for leaving <hi>Rome</hi> and departing into <hi>Syria,</hi> and their living amongſt Heathens: Yet he ſo excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in many particulars, that his Enemies were at laſt aſhamed of their Accuſations, ſo that he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57946:64"/>
at <hi>Rome</hi> Teaching and Inſtructing many in the Faith, and eſpecially the noble Matrons, in the Houſes of one of whom he lived. By this time the <hi>Arrians</hi> being grown powerful, began to ſpread their infection abroad, and at laſt were ſo bold as to endeavour the bringing over St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> to their Party, the reaſon they had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive he would adhere to them, was, becauſe he read <hi>Origen</hi>'s Works: But when he heard what they intended, he utterly deteſted againſt them, and to avoid any ſcandal he left <hi>Rome,</hi> and much Repented him that he had come thither, for now the Church growing Rich, Chriſtian ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and ſincere Religion began to be laid aſide, and Formalities, and Traditions heaped up in their ſtead.</p>
                  <p>Having paſſed through ſome Countries, and Viſited many of his former Acquaintance, he came again into <hi>Syria;</hi> and in his Journey he grew into Familiar Acquaintance with that Worthy Man <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> whom he ever after called his Maſter. Of him he Learned many things, a while after by the perſwaſion of <hi>Apollinarius</hi> he went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and there compleated his Studies in Divinity by the help of <hi>Didymus,</hi> and a while after he went and ſetled himſelf at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where he taught the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and Converted many. So that growing famous, he wanted not Enemies: For the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> fearing he would prove their Chief Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, endeavoured by all poſſible means to blaſt his Fame, and there ſet one <hi>Ruffinus</hi> to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to aſperſe the Truth with falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which ſo grieved the Holy Man, that he then reſolved to be ſilent in the matter no longer,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57946:65"/>
but ſharply rebuked the Heretick both by Words and Writing, whereupon they charged him with many heinous Crimes, but he ſo managed the matter that all men plainly diſcerned their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                  <p>Some there were that took his part and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him againſt the Hereticks, but he it was that always bore the brunt, being ever perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moleſted; nay, his Life put often in danger by theſe Sects. When after having paſt over Thirty Years, as it were in a Sea of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what with Writing, ſitting up late, hard Studying, and long Journies, he was ſo ſpent, that Nature was no longer able to ſubſiſt. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that we may well ſay, he Sacrificed himſelf for the benefit of the Church, Dying <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 422. and of his Age 91. He wrote many large volumns, being a man of ſingular Chaſtity, of great Wit, ſlow to Anger, and in Learning exceeding moſt of his Time.</p>

                  <p>ST. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was Born at <hi>Antioch,</hi> his Fathers Name was <hi>Secundus,</hi> and his Mother's <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa,</hi> being both deſcended of Noble extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. When he came to Years of diſcretion he was put under the Tutorage of <hi>Libanus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, where he applyed himſelf to all the Studies of humane Learning, and greatly reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch as lived looſe and ungoverned lives, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to embrace the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, when after a while he perſwaded ſeveral of his Companions to caſt of the cares of the World, and apply their minds wholly to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Divine Sapience. He alſo aſſociated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> by whoſe grave Inſtructions he greatly profited. A while after his fame of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encreaſing, he by the Biſhop of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was made Reader of the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> In which ſtation he ſo diſcreetly behaved himſelf, that ſtill he increaſed in the good opinions of the People; when a while after the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> Dying, he was by the unanimous conſent of the Clergy choſe Biſhop in his ſtead, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour highly approving of the choice.</p>
                  <p>When he was ſetled in that See, he made it his whole Study to Reform the Errors that were crept into the Church, as alſo the Lives of the Clergy, whom he freely reproved for their faults.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57946:66"/>
When at that time finding a great Schiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Weſtern and Eaſtern Churches; he laboured diligently to unite their Opinions, nor were his endeavours altogether fruſtrated.</p>
                  <p>He Converted many Pagans and Atheiſts, to the belief and veneration of the true God. Inſomuch that he grew famous throughout all the Eaſt, ſo that the conflux of People that reſorted to his Sermons were exceeding great, and when he heard that the Biſhops of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> by reaſon of their wicked Lives were altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to Govern the Churches, He depoſed Thirteen of them, placing Pious and Learned men in their rooms, which aftewards created him no ſmall trouble: For thoſe that were thus outed gathering their Friends together, oppoſed him in many things, raiſing ſcandals, and lay grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Crimes to his Charge, and amongſt the reſt they ſtirred up <hi>Eutropius,</hi> one of the Emperours Eunuches, who was the Emperours eſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite. This man procured of the Emperour that a Law ſhould be made, that if any Malefactor took Sanctuary, he might be drag'd out of the Church to Execution, but to ſee the juſt judgment of God, not long after this Eunuch being Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for abuſing the Empreſs, he fled to the Church, and there lay under the Communion Table, when as the Sunday following St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> Preaching, took occaſion to diſcourſe about the unſtability of Greatneſs, and how wicked men though never ſo highly exalted ſtood in ſlippery Places, when at that time the People carryed the Eunuch out of the Church, and according to the Law that himſelf had procured to be Enacted, delivered him up to the Emperours Officers,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57946:66"/>
who at the Emperours Command beheaded him.</p>
                  <p>About this time the <hi>Arrians</hi> began to trouble the Church, by withdrawing many from the Truth to embrace their Erroneous Opinions, as likewiſe a great difference aroſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſome affirming that God the Father had a Body in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, which others as ſtrongly oppoſed, but <hi>Theophilus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> holding with the formers Opinion many of the latter were obliged for their better ſafety to fly to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> there to make their complaints to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as likewiſe to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> the Biſhop who received them into the Church, which ſo greived <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salamine</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that they uſed their utmoſt endeavours to ſtir up the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy againſt him.

                  <p>A while after <hi>Theophilus</hi> came to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and there calling a Counſel by the Command of the Emperour, he ſo far wrought that they depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and he was thereupon ſent into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, though much againſt the minds of the People who Guarded his Houſe three days to prevent his being carried thence.

                  </p>
                  <p>When he came to Maturity, he kept a School in the City where he was born, and a while after departing thence he went to <hi>Rome;</hi> having alſo taught Rhetorick in <hi>Carthage.</hi> When he had ſtayed at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome time, Hearing and Diſputing with the Doctors of the Church, he went thence to <hi>Millain,</hi> where he grew ſo famous that he was choſen Tutor to <hi>Valentinian</hi> the fifth Emperour where he alſo had frequent Converſe with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> Biſhop of that See, who within a while perſwaded him from him Errors, and cauſed him to be baptized.

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:57946:68"/>When he had continued at <hi>Millain</hi> ſome time, he returned into <hi>Africk;</hi> where upon Knowledge of his thorough Converſion, and the ſtrictneſs of his Godly Life, he was Choſen Miniſter of <hi>Hippo;</hi> in which Station he had not long continued, e're by his preaching and learned Diſputes he grew ſo famous that people came from all parts to hear him, when as <hi>Valerius</hi> the Biſhop of that place hearing they would elect him Biſhop of ſome place and ſo he ſhould looſe his Company, he cauſed him to retire for a while.

Gold; but he pleaded he was no Heretick, but in his Diſputation it was plainly proved againſt Him; yet <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſo far prevailed with the Proconſul, that the fine was remitted.</p>

Notwithſtanding others of the Sect diſputed with him afterwards, and were overcome, though they falſly boaſted that they had overcome him; which cauſed him to write all the Arguments over and publiſh them, to the ſhame and confuſion of his Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>He lived in the time when the Barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> broke in upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and tore it to peices, deſtroying all before them, like an overflowing deluge, then the Churches were Fired, Robbed and Beaten down; the Biſhops Murthered, or put to extream torment, the Miniſters racked to death, and all ſorts of People ſlain on heaps, Virgins deflowered, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Raviſhed, Children puſhed againſt the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all manner of Barbarity Exerciſed; then it was that <hi>the red horſe was ſent out to take peace from the Earth.</hi>

                  <p>Being made a Presbyter at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel plainly and powerfully Converting many Pagans to the Chriſtian Faith; and by his Writings greatly profited the Church, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Arians</hi> and Hereticks to the utmoſt of his power; by his great Learning Convincing many of their Errors, and Confounding the obſtinate in their own Arguments: But at laſt having finiſhed his Courſe, he yielded to death in certain hope of a glorious Crown of Life and Immortality; Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the year 750. He wrote many Books, but eſpecially his 3 Books of Parallels of the Holy Scriptures, and his 4 Books of the Orthodox Faith.</p>

                  <p>And now this Godly Youth began more and more to apply himſelf to the Study of Sacred things: Yet at laſt was prevailed with to take upon him a publick Employment, which was to gather the Kings Taxes; in which he uſed ſuch Mildneſs and Moderation, that he Generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the love of the People. But ſuch buſineſs ill agreeing with his Temper, he grew impatient of ſuch publick affairs, and reſolved to betake himſelf to a more retired Courſe of Life, having long conſidered by what means he might beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, he at laſt concluded to retire himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Monaſtery, (which in thoſe days were Places where Sincerity and true Religion flouriſhed though ſince they have degenerated into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57946:74"/>
of Superſtition and Prophaneneſs) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one day going to veiw the place he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter, and perceiving the Quietneſs, Love, and friendly Converſe that were amongſt the Brethren, he broke forth into theſe words.</p>

                     <hi>Why travel I in the World which can yeild me no future nor durable Felicity, ſuitable to my Toil and Labour? Though it be better to weep well than joy ill, yet if to Joy be our deſire, how much excelleth their Joy who have a good Conſcience before God, who dread nothing but Sin, ſtudy to do nothing, but to accompliſh the Precepts of Chriſt? Now therefore let me change my Trade, and as before I endeavoured againſt my noble Friends to prove the more Noble, ſo now let my care and employment be amongſt the humble and poor Servants of God, to become more humble and poor than they: and like the good Evangeliſt St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>of a Publican let me become a Diſciple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he had thus ſaid, he reſolved to enter himſelf one of the Society; and thereupon began to accuſtom himſelf to Watching, Prayer and Faſting.

He told
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57946:74"/>
him what hardſhip he muſt undergo relating all the Severity of a Monaſtick Life; with which <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was very well content, and thereupon was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the houſe which his mother had no ſooner notice off, but ſhe came and demanded him of the Biſhop; making many Exclamations, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>that he had traduced her Son, to the taking away of all her Comfort, and utter decay of her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> But he refuſed to return, although ſhe uſed many perſwaſive Arguments to induce him thereto. Yet did he render her all dutiful reſpect, earneſtly recommending her to the Protection of Heaven, and freely giving all his Goods to her and his younger Brother, reſolving for the ſake of his great Maſter the Lord Jeſus, not only to leave the World, but to <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> and rather run the hazard of diſpleaſing all, than when he had <hi>put his hand to the Plough to lock back,</hi> and thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him to his Exerciſe which he obſerved ſo truly that by rigorous Faſting he much impaired his bodily health, yet he delayed not his devout Studies, but exhorted his Elders to <hi>ſuffer all things for the ſake of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>He had not continued in this ſtate many years, before his Fame was ſpread through all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which cauſed the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks to envy him, and therefore raiſing a perſecution againſt ſuch as ſincerely ſerved God, he together with the Biſhop <hi>Fauſtus</hi> and the reſt, were forced to fly and procure ſuch places of reſidence as was moſt for their ſafety, when, as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> coming to a little Monaſtery (of which a pious man, named <hi>Felix,</hi> was Governour) he no ſooner diſcloſed who he was, but <hi>Felix,</hi> having heard of his Fame, offered to reſign him his place, as counting him the moſt

worthy to undertake ſo divine a charge; but he refuſed it; yet at the Intreaty of the Society he was content to become his fellow helper, and ſo continued to the good liking of all Pious men for a long time; when by reaſon of the hot Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſtill purſued him; he with the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted into the Territories of <hi>Sicca,</hi> in the Wilds of <hi>Africk,</hi> where he Preacht and Inſtructed the People, turning many Souls to Chriſt; but even here he was not ſafe, for his fame ſoon ſpreading, his Enemies ſtill purſued them with their Malice, and ſought by all means to deſtroy him; but God, in whom he truſted, ſtill delivered him from Death, although they layd ambuſhes both for him and <hi>Felix,</hi> and having taken them, they were carryed before an <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhop, who cauſed them grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly to be beaten, which made them rejoyce <hi>that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the ſake of their Bleſſed Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To avoid the Perſecution, <hi>Fulgentius</hi> intended to ſail into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but by contrary Winds, was driven into the Haven of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there being perſwaded by the Biſhop to ſtay all Winter, he the next Spring travelled to <hi>Rome;</hi> and there beholding the glittering ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of that great City, he ſaid, <hi>How beautiful may the Coeleſtial</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>be, when Terreſtrial</hi> Rome <hi>is ſo gorgeous.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57946:75"/>
to his ſtudies, he wrote ſeveral Books; but his Diſciples hearing where he was, came to him, and requeſted him to return, which at the deſire of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> he conſenting to, was made a Presbyter; the <hi>Arian</hi> King having commanded that no more Biſhops ſhould be made, and now every City ſtrove who ſhould have him for their Paſtor; But above all, the City of <hi>Ruſpa</hi> ſo earneſtly ſolicited him, that partly with, and partly againſt his will, he was made Biſhop; which ſo incenſed the King, that he not only baniſhed him, but 60 others, moſt of them being Biſhops; yet within a while after he ſent for <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> to reaſon with him about divers matters, thereby to Intrap him, but he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued ſo warily, and returned ſuch anſwers, that he confirmed a great many of his Hearers that were before ſtaggering into Error; yet again was he baniſhed, but at his departure he ſaid, <hi>He ſhould ſhortly return again, and that the Church ſhould enjoy much peace and quiet within few years;</hi> Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came to paſs: For <hi>Tharſamund</hi> dying, <hi>Hildelick</hi> was crowned in his ſtead, who revoked the many ſevere Edicts of his Predeceſſor, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling home the Biſhops and Paſtors, reſtored them to their dignities.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57946:78"/>When at any time he heard of Perſons that were troubled in Mind, he would go to them, and give them words of Conſolation, laying before them the Promiſes of our bleſſed Saviour, and the infinite deſire he has to ſave Sinners, Charging them not to give way to deſpair, but lay hold on the Lord Jeſus as the Rock of Salvation, and by ſuch means he drew many Souls out of the Paws of the Devil, who like a Lyon was ready to devour them.</p>
                  <p>He greatly gave himſelf to Meditation and Prayer. He likewiſe Preach'd after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. <hi>Paul, both in and out of Seaſon,</hi> and was ſo earneſt in the delivery of his Sermons, that his words ſeemed to have a more than ordinary Power with them; which ſo affected the hearers that People came from all parts to his Lectures.</p>
                  <p>He hated Idleneſs, and when he had nothing to do in publick affaires, he always kept to his Study, reading and well conſidering the works of the Fathers; gathering out of them ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as might be moſt powerful to win Souls unto Chriſt, of which he compiled his famous <hi>Pharetra,</hi> and the better to keep himſelf employed he wrote the Bible over with his own hand, and ſo well uſed it, that he could readily Cite all the material Texts by heart.</p>
                  <p>After he had continued at the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> for the ſpace of three years, he was choſen Divinity Reader, which he ſo well diſcharged, that all men admired his Eloquence and Learning after this he was made Doctor of Divinity, in which Station he continued for a conſiderable time doing all the deeds of Charity that lay in his Power to perform, as likewiſe perſwaded others
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57946:79"/>
to do the Like; ſo that at laſt, ſpent with tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Studies, nature decayed in him, and he falling ſick, after many pious Exhortations to his Friends to perſevere in the way to ſaving Knowledge, he gave up the Ghoſt, Dying <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1274, and of his Age 53, and was buried in a Stately Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre in the Cathedral; great Mourning being made for him by all Lovers of Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

ſo that men wandered in Darkneſs, and as under the Jewiſh Law, inſtead of Real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were forced to content themſelves with Types and Shadows; theſe were they that would neither enter themſelves, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit others, but verified the Old Proverb uſed by their School-men, when they affirm that Ignorance is the Mother of (blind) Devotion; yet ſuch was the abundant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that God, <hi>who delights not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould be converted and live,</hi> that when it was leaſt ſuſpected, <hi>he brought Light out of Darkneſs,</hi> and raiſed up ſuch faithful Servants, <hi>as ſpared not to cry aloud, and lift up their Voyces like a Trumpet,</hi> &amp;c. by whoſe faithful preaching and expounding the Everlaſting Goſpel, and by the operation of the Holy

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57946:85"/>
a Trade made of Religion, as it is by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Clergy at this day; then with the Goſpel of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour they mixed the Traditions of men, the Popes frequently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to diſpence with Scripture, to Inſtitute Sacraments of their own Invention, ſet up Idols in Churches, pray for the Dead, worſhip Saints, and the like; but as in all Ages God had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Church to himſelf, and our Saviour has promiſed, <hi>that the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it:</hi> So I ſay, when the Publick Church was ſo much degenerated from its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Worſhip, that it had almoſt loſt the name of Chriſtianity for that of Paganiſme, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up their abominable Idols, though under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Titles, God raiſed up his faithful Servants openly to oppoſe ſuch monſtrous wickedneſs, only to teach the Ignorant, who had ſo long been led aſtray in the dark miſts of Error, the way to ſaving knowledg, and accordingly gave a bleſſing to their Preaching and Doctrine, as we ſhall ſee in the Lives of the great Doctors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church: And firſt I ſhall begin with <hi>John Wicklif,</hi> our Country man, who durſt to the hazard of his Life, oppoſe the avarice and cruel dealing of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, as hereafter will more plainly appear.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57946:86"/>
affected, by putting many Logical and Metaphyſical Queſtions to them, and then venturing a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he laſt came to argue about the Sacrament, which was then adminiſtred in the Church far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Inſtitution of our bleſſed Saviour, and his holy Apoſtles, by which he ſoon alarumed the Popiſh Clergy, who like <hi>Demetrius,</hi> when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached down the Idols at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> knew that if ſuch matters came once to the teſt, they ſhould loſe a great part of their livelihood, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Ignorance was the Mother of the People's Devotion.</p>
                  <p>Upon his diſcovery of the Cheats of the Romiſh Clergy, the Monks and Fryers came ſwarming about him, threatning him with grievous puniſhments, if he did not publickly recant all he had ſaid; the which he refuſing to do, the Archbiſhop ſent for him, and although he learnedly proved out of the Scriptures and the Fathers what he had ſaid, yet the Archbiſhop deprived him of his Prieſtly Office, and would have proceeded to have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him for a Heretick, had not God ſtirred up the King to favour him, as likewiſe, <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the King's Son, who did it the rather to oppoſe him againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of ſome Affronts he had put upon him, yet ſo far the Biſhops prevailed with the King, that they got leave to convene <hi>Wicklif</hi> before them in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, upon which the Archbiſhop <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> ſent out his Citation for him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at a day prefixed, when with him came the Duke, the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> and others encouraging him not to be afraid of his Adverſary. When he came before the Biſhops, the Lord <hi>Percy</hi> commanded him to ſit down, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57946:86"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſtrongly oppoſed, alledging it was both againſt Law and Reaſon, that one being cited to anſwer to ſuch things as were to be laid to his Charge, ſhould ſit before his Ordinary; but the Duke ſeconding <hi>Percy,</hi> a great conteſt aroſe, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the multitude without doors hearing of it, threatned the Duke, and the Lord <hi>Percy;</hi> and certain it is, had they not made their eſcapes they had murthered them; ſo that the Convocation was forced to diſſolve.</p>
                  <p>For ſome time after <hi>Wicklif</hi> liv'd quietly, and by preaching his ſound Doctrine, opened the eyes of many, inſomuch that he gained a number of Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; but after King <hi>Edward</hi> dyed, and <hi>Richard</hi> Son to the Black Prince was Crowned King, the Biſhop began to vex him afreſh, having drawn up theſe following Articles againſt him out of his Writings and Sermons.</p>

                  <p>Encouraged by theſe Letters, the Biſhops were reſolved to proceed againſt him, come what would come; in order to which he was brought before them Aſſembled in the Provincial Councel; but in midſt of their Expectation of Revenge, all their Sport was ſpoyl'd by the coming of one <hi>Lewis Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who charged them <hi>in the King's Name not to proceed to any Definitive Sentence;</hi> whereupon when they had charged him to preach no more to the People, they diſmiſſed him, when not long after the Archbiſhop, <hi>Wicklif</hi>'s Capital Enemy was beheaded by the Multitude, <hi>Anno</hi> 1382. <hi>Courtney</hi> being made Biſhop in his room he called a Convocation in <hi>Grey Fryers,</hi> whither <hi>Wicklif</hi> was ſummoned, but in the midſt of the Buſineſs there happened ſuch a terrible Earthquake, that many of the Suffragans were ſo terrified, that they left the matter; yet the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop ſtayed, and there declared <hi>Wicklif</hi>'s Doctrine Heretical, Erroneous, and Irreligious, and ſo far prevailed with the King, as by his Letters Patents, to deliver him up wholly to their mercy, as likewiſe to ſend his Letters to the Vice-chancellor of <hi>Oxford</hi>

to excommunicate him, and make diligent ſearch there to apprehend him, and all ſuch as adhered to his Doctrine, of which he having notice, he retired in ſecret, where he continued for fome time, and then returned to his Parſonage of <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where after all the Perſecution and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his Enemies, he dyed in Peace, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1384. but after his Death many of his famous Writings were burnt by the Popiſh Clergy.</p>

                     <hi>JOhn Huſs</hi> was a <hi>Bohemian</hi> by birth, being born in a Town called <hi>Huſſinets,</hi> near to <hi>Prague,</hi> when grown up, he was by his Parents ſent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Prague,</hi> where he became famous for his Wit and Learning, when at laſt happ'ning on ſome of <hi>Wicklif</hi>'s Books that had ſcaped the Flames; he ſo far weighed the Contents that he found them to concord with the Scriptures and Primitive Fathers, upon which he began to deteſt againſt the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Popery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1393. being Commenced Batchelor of Arts, with the Approbation of the whole Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he after that became Maſter of Arts, at which time two godly Gentlemen of <hi>Prague,</hi> building the Church of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſometime after it was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Mr. <hi>Huſs</hi> was made Miniſter of the ſame, where he ſo plainly and powerfully preached the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that all that heard him greatly profited
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57946:88"/>
in ſaving knowledge, continuing ſo to do for the ſpace of Twelve years, which Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fifth hearing, and fearing that the knowledge of the Scriptures would make the People abhor his Councils, Decrees, and other Trumpery, which had been thruſt into the Religious Worſhip of the Church, he ſent his Citation for <hi>Huſs</hi> to appear before him at <hi>Rome,</hi> when as he went not himſelf, but ſent his Proctor, who anſwered to all the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that were laid againſt him, and cleared his Innocency; yet the Pope was nothing contented, but condemned him though abſent for a Heretick, and pronounced his Bugbear of Excommunication againſt him, which cauſed King <hi>Winceſlaus</hi> to baniſh him; yet was he taken into the Protection of the Lord of the Soil of <hi>Huſſinets,</hi> and there by his preaching he ſo diſplayed the wickedneſs of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he cauſed many to embrace his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>When he perceived it convenient, he would likewiſe repair to his Church at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there inſtructed his Flock, and exhort them to be ſtedfaſt in the Truth, and not to ſuffer the poyſon of Popery to taint their Souls, telling them, that only for their owning the Name of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, it could not be diſtinguiſhed from the Heathen Idolatries.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57946:88"/>
to face his Enemies, and not doubting if he could fairly be heard, but to put his Accuſers to ſhame and confuſion; with him went ſeveral of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Nobility, and by the way he ſet up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Publick Writings ſignifying his departure, and upon what occaſion he went.</p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Noremberg,</hi> the Citizens having notice of his Arrival, came flocking about him, and ſo far prevailed with him, as to inſtruct them, the which he did from Noon till it was Evening, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome, and confounding others in their own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that went about to oppoſe him; one thing by the way is very obſervable, for as one <hi>Staviſtaus Zonoma</hi> a <hi>Bohemian,</hi> who was his greateſt Accuſer, was on his way to <hi>Conſtance,</hi> he was ſmote by the hand of God, and dyed by the way of an Impoſthume.</p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Conſtance,</hi> he was ſent for to appear before the Council, to give an account of his Doctrine, which he chearfully did, telling them that he came for no other end; but for as much as all the <hi>Council were not yet come, he deſired it might be deferred, but if they would oblige him to it then, he was ready, not doubting but Chriſt would ſtrengthen him to do it, nor did he fear to ſuffer death for the ſake of his Great Maſter;</hi> but in fine, after they had examined him to ſome Particulars, and found how prompt he was to anſwer all their Objections, they thought it not beſt to meddle further at that time, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Letter of ſafe Conduct, they ſent him to a naſty Priſon, by reaſon of the noiſomneſs of which he fell ſick, and was in great danger of his Life.</p>
                  <p>During the time he continued in Priſon, they drew up ſome Articles of their own Invention, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57946:89"/>
Villains to teſtifie the ſame, which he hearing was greatly grieved, and thereupon moved, that ſeeing he could not be there himſelf, he might have an Advocate, but that was utterly denied him, and he removed by order of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> to the other ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and put into a ſtrong Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bohemian</hi> Lords hearing of this hard uſage towards Mr. <hi>Huſs,</hi> were greatly grieved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon petitioned the Council to have regard to the Honour of their King, who had granted <hi>Huſs</hi> his Letters of ſafe Conduct; for that if they were ſo ſuffered to be broken it would redound greatly to the diſgrace, not only of the King, but the Noble Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> Therefore they deſired he might be ſet at liberty, and ſuffered to plead for himſelf; but this nothing prevailed with the proud Prelates, but rather encreaſed their malice towards him, for thoſe that were appointed to be his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in his Abſence, heard all his Accuſers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prompted them when they were out; yet at laſt they conſented to bring him to his Tryal, though had it not been for the Emperour, they had proceeded to have paſſed Sentence without hearing him one word.</p>
                  <p>The day he was brought before them there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſuch an Eclipſe of the <hi>Sun</hi> that the like had not been known in many Ages, when he was come into their preſence they fell to hiſſing and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo at times that his defence could not be heard though he often prayed for ſilence, ſome of them all the while railing at him, and reviling him on purpoſe that he might not be heard, and when they perceived they could make nothing againſt him out of his Doctrine, they brought falſe Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57946:89"/>
him that he ſhould ſpeak Treaſonable Words againſt the Emperour; but that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by a Lord then preſent: yet they reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taking away his Life; which he perceiving, <hi>Appealed to the Pope, and from him to Chriſt;</hi> for which they greatly derided him, not permitting him to ſpeak for himſelf, although he beſought them with tears <hi>to ſhew him what Errors he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that if there were any thing in his Doctrine diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the word of God he would willingly confeſs his Error:</hi> but nothing leſs then his life would ſatisfie their bloody revenge, whereupon they proceeded to degrade him, and afterwards condemned him. Upon which he kneeling down prayed to God to turn their hearts, ſaying, <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt forgive my Enemies, by whom thou knoweſt I am falſly accuſed; forgive them I beſeech thee for thy great mercy's ſake.</hi> Yet in degrading him they were ſo cruel as to cut the skin from off the crown of his head with Shears, and in that Council to diſanull the Emperors Letters of ſafe conduct they made a Decree that no faith ſhould be kept with Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>After which they prepared for his Execution and put a cap upon his head, painted with Devils, the which he joyfully put on, ſaying, <hi>that ſince his Lord and Maſter wore for his ſake a Crown of Thorns, he would not diſdain for his ſake to wear that Cap;</hi> when he had put it upon his head a Biſhop ſtanding by, ſaid, <hi>Now we commit thy ſoul to the Devil,</hi> (a very uncharitable expreſſion,) but <hi>Huſs</hi> lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven, ſaid, <hi>Into thy hands Lord Jeſus I commend my Spirit which thou haſt redeemed with thy moſt precious Blood.</hi> Then they burnt his Books at which he with a joyful Countenance ſaid to the People, <hi>Think not good People that I dye for any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57946:90"/>
Hereſie or Error, but through the hatred and malice of mine Adverſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as he lifted up his face in prayer the Cap fell off, whereupon a Souldier put it on again ſaying, <hi>he ſhould burn with his maſters the Devils whom he had ſerved.</hi> Then he riſing up, ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus Aſſiſt and help me, that with a conſtant and patient mind by thy moſt gracious help I may bear and ſuffer this Ignominious death whereunto I am condemned for the preaching thy moſt holy Goſpel.</hi> Then as they were binding him to the Stake with a Chain he ſaid with a merry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <hi>that he would embrace that Chain for Chriſt's ſake; who for his ſake had been bound with a far worſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the fire was kindled he began to ſing with a loud voice, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son of the Living God have mercy upon me,</hi> the which after he had repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three times, the flame ſtopped his breath, his heart being afterwards found, they roſted it upon a Stake, and gathering up his Aſhes, they caſt them into the <hi>Rhine.</hi> He ſuffered Martyrdom, <hi>Anno Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> 1415.</p>
                  <p>One thing more is very memorable, <hi>viz.</hi> he told them at his death, that within a hundred years out of thoſe Gooſe Aſhes (his name in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Language ſignifying a Gooſe) ſhould ſpring a Swan in <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe ſinging would afright all thoſe Vulters, which was exactly verified in <hi>Luther;</hi> yet God delayed not to revenge the death of this good man, for he ſoon after raiſed up <hi>Ziska,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining War againſt the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a thouſand Popiſh Monaſteries.</p>

When he heard that notwithſtanding the Letters of ſafe Conduct, <hi>John Huſs</hi> was burnt, he was reſolved the more openly to maintain the Cauſe of his Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, and thereupon he went to <hi>Conſtance</hi> whilſt the Council was ſitting, from whence he retiring to <hi>Iberling,</hi> an Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty about a mile from thence, ſent to <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> for Letters of ſafe Conduct; but he refuſed to grant his requeſt, yet he was ſo far from being daunted that he wrote at Letter and ſet it up upon the gate of the City, intimating that he would, if ſent for, come freely to <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and there before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil make it appear that he neither preached nor maintained any Error or Hereſie, as it had been falſly ſuggeſted by many Slanderers and ſcandalous Perſons; but having no anſwer to what he had written, he by the perſwaſion of his Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned towards <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but by the way was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and carried bound to <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where being preſented before the Biſhops, they charged him with running away, being cited, to which he anſwered, <hi>that it was becauſe he could get no ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, neither from the Emperour, nor them, nor did he

                     <hi>MArtin Luther</hi> was born, <hi>Anno</hi> 1483. at a Town in the Earldom of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> called <hi>Iſleben,</hi> his Father being <hi>John Luther</hi> of the ſame place, deſcended of honourable Parentage, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's name before her Marriage was <hi>Margaret Lindeman,</hi> who in his Infancy inſtructed him in the ways of Virtue, ſo far forth as his tender years were capable to bear.</p>
                  <p>When he came to years of diſcretion, he was ſent to <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> where in the Free-School he greatly profited in Learning, eſpecially he there was taught to expound the Apoſtles Creed, and make uſe of the Fathers, the reading of whoſe Works he greatly affected, when he had ſtayed there a conſiderable time, he went to the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Erford,</hi> where in a ſhort time he ſo profited in his Studies, that the whole Univerſity admired his Wit and Learning.</p>
                  <p>At twenty years of Age he was made Maſter of Arts, and Profeſſor of Phyſick, after which he ſtudied the Law; but none of theſe agreed with his temper, God having deſigned him for a better Work, whereupon he rejecting the former, bent his mind wholly upon ſtudying Divine Things, and to be the more retire from noiſe and worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he entered into the Colledge of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Monks; and became one of their Order, there he continued ſome time very zealous for the Romiſh
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57946:92"/>
Religion; but within a while he began to diſlike the Errors that had crept into that Church, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiving that the Religion was for the moſt part compoſed of Traditions, as the Ordinances of Councils and Decrees, the which were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſconſonant to the Word of God, ſo that by exceſſive grief for the Apoſtate ſtate of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, he fell ſick and almoſt deſpaired of recovery, when as an old Prieſt came to him, and bid him be of <hi>good comfort for that his Diſeaſe was not mortal, but that God would raiſe him up to be a comfort to many others;</hi> the ſame Prieſt alſo diſcourſed with him concerning Juſtification by Faith, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the Articles of the Creed; after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that ſickneſs he was made Presbyter, and by the perſwaſion of <hi>John Staupicius</hi> went to the Univerſity of <hi>Wintenber,</hi> where after he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for the ſpace of three years, and gained great commendation, he was by his Convent ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where beholding their diſſolute manner of living, and the wicked practices there uſed, he grew into a greater diſlike of that Religion, for there, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reports, he heard Strumpets at the Communion Table boaſt of their wickedneſs, and that he had heard others concerning the Bread and Wine, ſcoffingly ſay, <hi>that Bread thou art, and Bread thou ſhalt remain, and Wine thou art, and Wine thou ſhalt remain,</hi> which made him imagine that the Church ſtood in great need of Reformation, however he was at his return there made Doctor of Divinity, and many times preached before the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who heard him with great gladneſs, and much admired his Eloquence and Learning.</p>
                  <p>A while after he began to explain the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and many of the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57946:93"/>
began more and more to decline the Superſtitions of the Romiſh Church; ſo that when one <hi>John Tecelius</hi> coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> brought the Pope's Indulgencies into <hi>Germany,</hi> perſwading the People that they were of ſuch a ſin-purging quality, that what ever ſins they committed, if they could but purchaſe one of them, they ſhould have them all remitted; this wicked Impoſtor ſo ſtirs the Zeal of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he wrote againſt his Indulgencies, laying open the Cheat to the World, which ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Indulgence Merchant, that he bitterly exclaimed againſt him, and getting as many of his Books as he could, he burned them; whereupon he yet once more wrought againſt his Trumpery, at which time many of the Divines of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity took part with <hi>Luther</hi> in what he did, and now he began to preach his Doctrine of Reformation openly, defending it againſt the <hi>Auguſtin-Fryers</hi> at <hi>Hedleburg,</hi> he being honourably entertain'd by them of <hi>Worſtburg</hi> and <hi>Volfgang,</hi> the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> there; he drew many to partake with him in his Opinion, of which the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> having notice, ſent to advertiſe the Pope thereof, and to bid him take timely care for the extirpating the New O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions that were lately ſprung up, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever meaſures he ſhould take he would ſee them put in Execution throughout the Empire.</p>
                  <p>Upon the receipt of the Emperour's Letters, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> then holding the Papacy cited <hi>Luther</hi> to appear before the Council of Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſignified as much to Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; whereupon the Cardinal going to <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> and finding <hi>Luther</hi> there, deſir'd the Emperour to ſet a Guard upon him, in order to carry him to <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs he would ſpeedily recant, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt

                  <p>The Pope likewiſe wrote a Letter to the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> to complain againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him to entertain him within his Dukedom, and that if he took him within his Juriſdiction, he ſhould forthwith ſend him to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be condemned or acquitted; but the Elector gave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heed to the Pope's Letter, though he threatned him therein, if he complied not with his will: But when he perceived theſe Projects fail, he ſent to the Maſter of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Monks, to ſee if he could prevail with him to return to his former Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and renounce his later Opinion, but this proved alſo ineffectual.</p>

                  <p>After the death of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Charles,</hi> the Pope ſent to the Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> requeſting him to cauſe all <hi>Luther</hi>'s Books to be burnt, and that he would ſee <hi>Luther</hi> either executed in <hi>Saxony,</hi> or that he would ſend him guarded to <hi>Rome,</hi> to which the Duke replied, that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to yield Obedience to the Pope, but that he could not ſend <hi>Luther</hi> to him before his Cauſe was heard before the Emperor, and till he was convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of ſome Error, and then if he recanted not, he ſhould find no favour at his hands.</p>

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57946:94"/>A while after a Diſputation was held between <hi>Luther</hi> and one <hi>Eccius</hi> at <hi>Lipſick,</hi> wherein the former prevailed, and his Doctrine ſo ſpread it ſelf, that the Fryers and Monks fearing to be unhived, ſent to the Pope to charge him with neglecting the Church Affairs, by giving himſelf up to Pleaſures; in the mean time ſuffering the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> to ſpread even in the very heart of <hi>Germany,</hi> upon which the Pope began to beſtir himſelf, by ſending his Bull againſt him; in which he Excommunicated not only him, but all his Partakers, commanding all men to apprehend him, and bring him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that his Books ſhould be burnt, of which <hi>Luther</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt the Pope's Bull lately ſent out againſt him, together with ſeveral Decrees and Councils.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Emperor coming into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſo far prevailed with him, that he was content to hear him openly in the Diet, of which <hi>Luther</hi> having notice, greatly rejoyced, though ſome of his Friends perſwaded him from going, ſaying, that the Publick Faith would be broken, as it was with <hi>John Huſs;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he told them, <hi>That ſuch diſcouragements were caſt in his way by Satan, who knew that his Profeſſion of the Truth in ſuch a Noble Place would be a means to ſhake his Kingdom, adding, that if he knew there were as many Devils in</hi> Worms, <hi>as there were Tiles upon the Houſes, yet he would go thither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He being arrived at <hi>Worms,</hi> ſome of the Popiſh Clergy went about to perſwade the Emperor to apprehend him, and commit him to Priſon; but he would by no means hearken to their wicked Counſel, alledging that the Publick Faith ought not to be broken; the next day after his coming he Preſented himſelf before the Council aſſembled for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57946:95"/>
that purpoſe; the Emperor being there preſent, where one <hi>Eccius</hi> a Lawyer, at the Command of the Emperor made a Speech, <hi>In which he demanded of</hi> Luther, <hi>that he would retract his Works and Doctrine,</hi> telling him, <hi>that it was the Emperor's Pleaſure that he ſhould ſo do, and if he refuſed it he muſt expect his diſpleaſure,</hi> to which he replied, <hi>As to my Books, ſome of them tend to Faith, and to theſe my Adverſaries give an ample Teſtimony, others are againſt the Pope and his Doctrine, the which ſhould I revoke I ſhould confirm his Tyranny, and ſome of them are againſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, who defend the Popes Cauſe, againſt whom I muſt confeſs I have been ſomewhat too ſharp, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not revoke them, unleſs I will ſet open a Gap for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of many.</hi>

                  <p>The next day the Biſhop of <hi>Trevers</hi> ſent for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and uſed many Arguments to perſwade him to a Recantation, telling him withall, that if he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57946:95"/>
it was the Emperor's purpoſe to baniſh him, to whom <hi>Luther</hi> replied, <hi>That he took it as a favour, that ſo great a Prince would put himſelf to ſo much trouble for ſo mean a Perſon as he was;</hi> after that one <hi>Vaeus</hi> a Lawyer came from the Emperor to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to recant, but he not conſenting to his requeſt, the Emperour ſent to him to depart home, and withal gave him twelve days ſo to do, after the end of which he proſcribed him; whereupon Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> appointed ſome of his moſt truſty Nobles to convey him ſecretly to <hi>Wartsburg,</hi> where he continued ten Months notwithſtanding diligent ſearch was made for him, and great ſums of money offered: nay, his Enemies imployed Wizards and Witches to uſe their Art to find out the place of his abode, but in vain; at the end of ten Months he returned to <hi>Wintenber,</hi> where he was moſt joyfully received by the Univerſity, from whence he ſent Letters to Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> to excuſe himſelf for leaving <hi>Wartsburg</hi> without his knowledge, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>That it was God's Cauſe he undertook, and that God would protect him from the rage of his Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A while after he printed the New Teſtament which he had tranſlated into the <hi>German</hi> Tongue at <hi>Wartsburg,</hi> which place he uſually called his <hi>Patmos,</hi> which did not a little diſpleaſe King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi>

                  <p>About this time one <hi>Thomas Muncer</hi> wrote a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Book againſt his Doctrine, and perſwaded the Boors to Rebel, who being perſwaded by him to throw off all Obedience to their Princes, took Arms in great numbers, againſt which unlawful proceedings, <hi>Luther</hi> wrote ſeveral Treatiſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them to yield Obedience to their Princes, ſhewing them how diſconſonant ſuch practices were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57946:96"/>
to the word of God, but when this prevailed not the Princes drew out their Forces, and with more Convincing Arguments taught them Obedience. For coming to a Battel about five thouſand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them were ſlain, and their ſeditious Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders <hi>Mauncer</hi> and <hi>Peſtifer</hi> taken, the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon the Rack to confeſs his Accomplices, cryed out grievouſly, when as Prince <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> bid him <hi>think upon the ſlaughter of the Poor wretches, who ſeduced by him fell in battel the day before:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he laughing out-right ſaid, <hi>they would be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;</hi> in fine he and his Companion with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were beheaded; but ſo ended not the War, which was call'd the War of the Clowns, for before the Rebellion was ſuppreſſed about fifty thouſand were ſlain.</p>
                  <p>A while after <hi>Luther</hi> married one <hi>Katharine</hi> a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> againſt the Will of moſt of his Friends, tho <hi>Melancthone</hi> greatly Commended him for ſo doing, ſaying there was more then ordinary Cauſes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him ſo to do. But within a ſhort time <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> fell ſick with a Congealing of Blood, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while after recovered in his Sickneſs; it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him that the noiſe of a tempeſtuous Sea was beating at his Ears the which he ſaid <hi>if it did not ceaſe he ſhould dye,</hi> and no ſooner did the noiſe come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Head but he fell down as dead, but means being uſed he came again to himſelf, and this he took as a Temptation of Satan, and upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions he was wont to repeat the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: <hi>Be of good Comfort for I have overcome the World.</hi> And would often ſay that a man would go upon his Knees to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to fetch ſuch a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1523. a Diet was held at <hi>Norinberg,</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57946:96"/>
where the Edict of <hi>Worms</hi> was made void, upon which the Popes Legat complained grievouſly ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That ſince the Publication of the Edict neither</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>nor any of his Accomplices had been puniſhed.</hi> To which the Princes anſwered, <hi>That ſince the Pope and his Clergy had neglected Reformation in the Church,</hi> Germany <hi>had been greatly enlightened by the Sermons of</hi> Luther, <hi>and that if they ſhould go about to Puniſh him, the People would think they went about to extinguiſh the Light of the Goſpel, the better to obſcure thoſe manifeſt Vices that could be no longer hid; and that ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings would raiſe up great Tumults.</hi> The <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> ſeeing this reſolved to bribe him into ſilence, but in vain: a while after <hi>Luther</hi> being ſummoned to <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> he there made a Confeſſion of his Faith in ſeventeen Articles, to the great Satisfaction of moſt that heard him.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1545. a notorious Lye was Printed in <hi>Italy</hi> about <hi>Luther</hi>'s Death, which was that when he ſaw he muſt dye, he requeſted that his Body might be laid upon the Altar and worſhipped; but when his Body was laid in the Grave, ſuch a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earthquake happened as if the Foundation of the Earth was looſened, when as the People look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up beheld the Hoſt hovering in the Air, the which they took and laid upon the Altar, when the night following a loud noiſe and ratling was heard more terrible then the former, which terrified all the City: and in the Morning his Sepulcher being opened, they found neither Body Bones nor Cloaths, but ſuch a ſtink of Brimſtone iſſued thence as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all the ſtanders by; and almoſt choaked thoſe that opened it. This Lye coming Printed into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Luther</hi> read it and ſubſcribed it with his own hand; ſhewing the Malice and Folly of the Pope
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57946:97"/>
and his Agents: A while after he was ſent for by the Counts of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> to Compoſe a difference between them about the Borders of their Countries, and Inheritances, when as not been accuſtomed to ſuch affairs, he took with him <hi>Melancthone</hi> and ſome others, and was by the Counts received upon the Borders with a hundred Horſe; where after he had ſetled the Temporal affairs, he fell to Preaching and Exhorting the people, and Adminiſtred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to many whom he thought fit Perſons to receive the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Within a while he fell ſick and grew exceeding weak, yet putting his truſt in God he ſupported himſelf to Comfort his Friends beyond meaſure; inſomuch that the day before his Death, he Dined and ſupped with <hi>Melancthone</hi> and the reſt of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices: but after Supper his Pain increaſing he retired to pray, and then went to Bed and there ſlept till Midnight, but then being awakened by the Pain and perceiving his Life near at an end, he called his Friends about him, and ſaid, <hi>I pray God to preſerve the Doctrine of the Goſpel amongſt us, for the Pope and the Councel of</hi> Trent <hi>have grievous things in hand.</hi> After which he made his Prayers, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired of God that he would defend his Church againſt the Pope, and all his Adherents.</p>
                  <p>When it was expected that he was about to dye, <hi>Juſtus Jonas</hi> and <hi>Caelius</hi> bid him be conſtant and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the Faith he had taught and held to the laſt, to which he anſwered, <hi>yea;</hi> and ſoon after gave up the Ghoſt, dying <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1546. he was a man of great Temperance and Abſtinence; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had the Papiſts hired Ruffians to kill him, but they had never the Power to do it; the Devil one time appeared to him (as he was walking in his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57946:97"/>
Garden) in the ſhape of a huge Boar, but he ſo flouted him that he ſoon vaniſht. He was wont to ſay, God would give Peace to <hi>Germany</hi> during his Life, but woe to them that ſhould Live after him: about four years after his Death his Wife falling out of a Wagon into a Lake, ſo bruiſed her ſelf, that ſhe dyed within ſix days, to the great Grief of all good People.</p>

When after a while going to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> he Commenced Maſter of Arts, where he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſo hard that he got <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> by heart; and gave his mind much to the ſtudy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, inſomuch that he could readily expound many of the difficult Phraſes therein contained, and then began he to think upon the Doctrine of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which having well weighed he plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it agreed in all Points with the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Whereupon he Preached againſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs of the times, and the Licentious living of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, laying open their wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57946:98"/>
and Idolatrous worſhip, withdrawing many from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> to the reformed Religion, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while he grew ſo Famous, that he was choſen Paſtor of a Church, called our Lords Hermitage, by <hi>Theobaldus</hi> Baron of that part of the Country where it ſtands.

                  <p>About a year after his Paſtorſhip, one <hi>Sampſon</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryer being ſent by the Pope to ſell In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, came into thoſe parts whom <hi>Zuinglius</hi> greatly oppoſed, plainly proving him to be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor and deceiver of the People, inſomuch that he perſwaded the People to keep him out of <hi>Zurick:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Indulgence-Merchant trotted to <hi>Bade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> where he expoſed his Trumpery to ſail, and often would fall into a fit of Bawling; <hi>Behold they fly, behold they fly,</hi> meaning the Souls that were delivered out of Purgatory by his Indulgences.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57946:98"/>
the Monaſteries, only allowing the Monks and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a Competency; they imployed the Over-plus to Charitable uſes, and Commanded that all Images in Churches ſhould be taken down, and burnt, which was done accordingly, as likewiſe the Maſs to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and the Lords Supper to be Adminiſtred as it was wont in the primitive Churches; they alſo forbid Proceſſion and remove the Martyrs Tombs, to prevent the Peoples worſhipping them; whereupon a Notary belonging to the Councel ſtood up, and grievouſly Complained that they had taken away the Ancient worſhip of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, againſt all right; whereupon a great Diſpute aroſe between him and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> about the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacrament, and many Arguments uſed on both ſides, ſo that it was put off to a further hearing, during which time <hi>Zuinglius</hi> dreamed that he being Non-pluſſed and ſitting down a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meſſenger ſtood by him, and <hi>ſaid, O thou Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard why doſt thou not anſwer him out of the</hi> 12. <hi>of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus?</hi> At which he awaking immediately ſtarted up, and taking his Bible turned to the Proof, and there found, <hi>this is the Paſſover of the Lord.</hi> The which text he afterwards oppoſing againſt his Adverſary, not only confounded him, but highly ſatisfied the whole Aſſembly, inſomuch that the next Sacrament day moſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Zurick</hi> were preſent.</p>

                  <p>About a Twelve-month after, another Diſpute was held at <hi>Bern,</hi> the which the Popiſh Cantons op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but it notwithſtanding went on, after which it was decreed that the Maſs, Altars, Images, and other ſuperſtitious Trumpery ſhould be aboliſhed, and that the Divine Service ſhould be continued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, and alſo they writ the day and year of their aboliſhing Popery, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Pillar ſet up for that purpoſe, in Letters of Gold that it might remain as a <hi>Memento</hi> to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the like Reformation was Effected at <hi>Baſil.</hi>

                  <p>When the Souldiers came to ſtrip the ſlain, <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> was found alive lying upon his Back with his eyes up to Heaven, whereupon they asked him if he would have a Prieſt to Confeſs him; to which he anſwered, no; they then bid him, call upon the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57946:100"/>
Idolatrous and Superſtitious worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and took the Parts of the reformed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, eſpecially ſuch as taught <hi>Wicklif</hi>'s Doctrine; upon which the Papiſts began to hate him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured many ways to inſnare him, reſolving to Rid him out of the way; whereupon they brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the name of <hi>Heretick,</hi> and made grievous Complaints againſt him to the King, that he went about to innovate Religion, and to ſtir up Rebellion; but the King being ſatisfied in his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gave little heed to the Accuſations of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, yet they ſo far prevailed that they got his Conſent to ſummon a Councel, and then the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> addreſſed himſelf to the King with many grievous Complaints againſt the <hi>Lord Cobham;</hi> hoping by ſuch means to caſt him out of the Kings favour, that ſo they might the boldlier proceed againſt him; but the King told them, <hi>That he being one of his Knights, and of an honourable Family, He would himſelf firſt Commune with him about his Opinion, and perſwade him to return to the Romiſh Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King having thus ſatisfied the Biſhop for the preſent, he ſent for the <hi>Lord Cobham</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to be an obedient Son of the Church, and that he would ſubmit himſelf to his Biſhop and Confeſs himſelf in an Error, to which he mildly anſwered: <hi>You, moſt worthy Prince, I am always wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready to obey, for as much as I know you to be the Miniſter of God; bearing the Sword for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well; unto you, next unto my Eternal God, I owe all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and ſubmit all that I have unto you, being ready at all times to do whatever you ſhall in the Lord command me. But as touching the Pope and his Spirituality I owe them no Suit nor Service, knowing him by the Scriptures,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57946:101"/>
to be the Great Anti-Chriſt, the Son of Perdition, the open Adverſary of God, and the abomination ſtanding in the Holy place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing this ſtout and Chriſtian-like anſwer, he diſmiſſed him with an Admonition that he would become obedient to the Church, but he utterly refuſing, the King at the reiterated Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the Arch Biſhop, delivered him up to be proceeded againſt as he ſaw fit; whereupon he conſulting the other Biſhops, they reſolved to cite the <hi>Lord Cobham</hi> to appear at a Council to be hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for that purpoſe at <hi>London,</hi> there to anſwer to ſuch Articles as ſhould be objected againſt him, but the Biſhops Sumner coming with his Citation to his Caſtle of <hi>Couling</hi> durſt not enter the Gate, without my <hi>Lord Cobham</hi>'s leave; the which he not obtaining return'd as wiſe as he went.</p>
                  <p>Then the Biſhop hired one <hi>John Butler,</hi> Door-keeper to the Kings Privy Chamber, to go with his Sumner, which he accordingly did; and telling the <hi>Lord Cobham</hi> that he had a meſſage for him from the King, he got Admittance; when coming to his Preſence he told him: <hi>It was the Kings Pleaſure he ſhould obey that Proceſs,</hi> to which he anſwered; <hi>That he would in no Caſe conſent to the deviliſh Practices of the Popiſh Prieſts.</hi> Upon notice of which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop being thoroughly nettled, ſent to fix the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon the great Church in <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> not far from his Caſtle; but it was ſoon torn down by ſome of the <hi>Lord Cobham</hi>'s Friends, the like being done three or four times; upon which he Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him, but he laught at ſuch his Proceedings, which inraged him yet the more; but at laſt the Lord finding the Malice of the Popiſh Clergy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe againſt him, he went Voluntarily to the King,

and carried with him the Articles of his Belief in writing, deſiring his Majeſty to ſuffer them to be peruſed by the Learned men of either Univerſity: And if they could any ways prove that they were diſagreeing to the word of God, he would ſubmit; or that according to the Law of Arms, <hi>In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Faith he would fight with any man Living, Chriſtian or Heathen; the King, his Royal Progeny and the Council excepted; and he would refuſe no Correction, that ſhould be inflicted according to the Law of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the King not daring to diſpleaſe the Arch-Biſhop, permitted him Perſonally to be ſummoned in his Privy Chamber; and upon his appealing from the Arch-Biſhop cauſed him to be Arreſted and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he cauſed his Confeſſion to be writ over again, during his Confinement.</p>
                  <p>A while after he being brought before the Arch-Biſhop and his Conſiſtory, the Arch-Biſhop proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abſolve him, if he would require it; but he told the whole Aſſembly, <hi>He needed it not, but was there ready to make a Confeſſion of his Faith, if ſo be they would Permit him.</hi> And thereupon he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to them in Writing, but they told him that although there were many good things contained therein, yet they had no leaſure to Examine them, but that he muſt anſwer to the Articles, and then they began to ask him his Opinion about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar, and Penance, but he ſaid, <hi>He had written his mind in the Paper, and would not enter into Diſcourſe about thoſe things further?</hi> Whereupon he was remanded to the <hi>Tower.</hi>

no need of his Abſolution,</hi> and when they told him that unleſs he would recant, they would condemn him as a Heretick, <hi>He bid them do as they thought beſt, for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am at a point, that which I have written I will ſtand to it to the death;</hi> and afterwards falling upon his knees he lifted up his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and ſaid, <hi>I ſhrive me here unto thee, O Eternal and ever-living God, in my frail Youth I offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, O Lord, by Pride, Covetouſneſs, Wrath, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and many men have I hurt in my anger, and committed many other horrible Sins, for which good Lord I ask thee forgiveneſs;</hi> and ſo with tears in his eyes he ſtood up, and turning to the People, ſaid, <hi>Lo, good People, for breaking God's Laws and his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments they never yet accuſed me, but for their own Laws and Tradition they handle me moſt cruelly, and therefore they and their Laws by God's promiſe ſhould be utterly deſtroyed;</hi> after which they proceeded farther to examine him, but he returned ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all their Queſtions, as made many wonder at his Wiſdom, yet they proceeded to read the Bill of Condemnation againſt him as a Heretick.

made his Eſcape, and fled into <hi>Wales,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued four years, even till the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; but then <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth coming to the Crown, the Biſhops fo far ſolicited him, that he offered great ſums of money to any that could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him; whereupon either for Lucre or Spite, the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> under pretence of friendſhip baſely betrayed him, ſo that being brought up to <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament then ſitting, he was carried before the Houſe of Lords, who upon ruminating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceedings againſt him, confirmed the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Biſhops, <hi>That-like a Traytor he ſhould be drawn through the Streets of</hi> London <hi>to the Gallows, in Saint</hi> Giles <hi>in the Fields, and there hanged, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards burnt upon the Gallows as he hung,</hi> which Sentence was accordingly put in Execution; but the Judgment of God ſoon overtook <hi>Thomas Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> his Capital Enemy, who condemned him, for his Tongue ſwelling in his mouth, he could not ſwallow any Food, and ſo was ſtarved to death.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> ſuffered Martyrdom, <hi>Anno</hi> 1417, he was a man of ſingular Piety, deſcended of a Noble and Ancient Family, a man of ſuch ſtrength and courage, that few durſt encounter him, and greatly beloved by his Prince, for the ſingular Services he had done him in the Wars, until ſuch time as the Biſhops traduced him, and turned him out of favour.</p>

                  <p>A while after, Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> being Lord Chancellor, and hearing of his return, offered a large ſum of money to any one that could appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, upon which a Taylor, one of his former Acquaintance, betrayed him, under pretence of concealing him in his Houſe, when being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended he was committed Priſoner to the Tower,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57946:103"/>
where he was often viſited by <hi>Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> who perſwaded him to recant his Opinions, but he abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, plainly ſhewing them, that what he held or had preached, was according to the word of God; he alſo diſputed with Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> both by Writing, and Word of Mouth, uſing ſuch convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Arguments, that he ſo far wrought upon Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that he afterwards confeſſed that he took his firſt Light of Reformation from Mr. <hi>Frith.</hi>

the Fathers, condemned him, and committed him to the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> to be burnt as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
                  <p>When he came into <hi>Smithfield,</hi> the place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Martyrdom, he with an undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage went to the Stake, where he was no ſooner faſtned, but the fire was kindled, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the laſt with ſuch Conſtancy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that many were converted by his Death, and began to pray to God to receive his Soul; but Dr. <hi>Cook</hi> forbid them, ſaying, <hi>They ought to pray for him no more than they would for a Dog,</hi> which uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expreſſion made many blame him.</p>

                  <p>After he had greatly profited in that Univerſity, and taken his Degree, he departed thence for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and having ſtayed there ſome time, he went into <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> and there lived with one Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> and became Tutor to his Children; to this Gentleman's houſe ſeveral of the Popiſh Doctors frequently-reſorted, with whom Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> had many Diſputes, and always worſted them, which did not a little encreaſe their hatred againſt him; during his being there he tranſlated a Book, called, <hi>Enchiridon Militis Chriſtiani,</hi> the which he preſented to Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> and his Lady, who reading, and duely weighing what was therein contained, they began to ſlight the Popiſh Prieſts, and not to entertain them ſo friendly as they were wont, the which the Prieſts attributed to Mr. <hi>Tindal,</hi> and thereupon fell to railing againſt him, and uſed all their endeavours

                     <hi>PAul Fagius</hi> was born in the Dominions of the Prince Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whoſe Parents being but of mean condition, he was firſt educated under his Father, who kept a School; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent to <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> where he greatly profited in Learning: and from thence at eighteen years of age he went to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> where he taught School, as likewiſe followed his ſtudying Divinity; ſo that growing famous, he at length aſſociated himſelf with <hi>Capito, Hedio, Bucer, Zellius,</hi> and other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Godly Miniſters of the Reformed Church:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57946:106"/>
and in a while after he married, and was called to the Miniſtry at <hi>Iſna;</hi> but the Study of the Tongues being moſt famous at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> by reaſon of the reſort of a number of exiled Miniſters, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go thither, and there continued to read Hebrew to thoſe that would hear him: and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he uſed to expound the Scriptures: but had not continued there long before he was called to his Paſtoral Charge of <hi>Iſna;</hi> in which he offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the ſpace of five years, and there being aſſiſted by <hi>Elias Levita,</hi> the famous Jew, whom he ſent for from <hi>Venice,</hi> he tranſlated ſeveral Books out of Hebrew, and ſet up a Preſs to Print the ſame; and ſo continued till the Plague broke out; nor then did he fly from his Charge, but exhorted the rich to be liberal to the poor, and diſtributed their Bounty with his own hands, as he ſaw occaſion, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Houſe to Houſe to ſee who lacked, even when the Contagion raged higheſt; ſo that it was counted by ſome miraculous, that he eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1542, the Paſtorſhip of <hi>Wolfgang,</hi> at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> having, by reaſon of his death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vacant for the ſpace of a year, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants ſent Meſſengers to deſire him to come thither, and to take the place upon him, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did. Firſt for two years and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo in love with his Doctrine, they by uſing their utmoſt endeavours, perſwaded him to ſtay two other years.</p>
                  <p>About the time when the War broke out in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> Elector of the Palatinate, intending to reform the Churches within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, ſent for <hi>Fagius,</hi> as well knowing him to be a man, not only eloquent, but of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; where he was no ſooner come, but had a place
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57946:107"/>
appointed him at <hi>Heidleberg</hi> to preach, and inſtruct the people, where, during his reſidence, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed many Books, which were very advantageous to ſuch as ſtudied the Hebrew Tongue, by which he growing yet more famous, <hi>Bucer, Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Hedio</hi> thought fit to entertain him as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in reading Divinity-Lectures. But the War increaſing, and the Emperor getting the upper hand of the Proteſtant Princes, the progreſs of Religion was hindered, and an Edict ſet forth for the baniſhing the Miniſters of the Goſpel, amongſt whom <hi>Fagius</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> went together, as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in joy or ſorrow; but before they departed out of the Empire, a Meſſenger was ſent out of <hi>England</hi> by Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> to fetch them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that they might be aiding in eſtabliſhing the Reformed Religion, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth then reigning. Nor was their coming fruitleſs, for they, by their unwearied Endeavours, confirmed many that were wavering. In fine, <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſet them to tranſlate the Old and New Teſtament after the exacteſt manner, with brief Notes upon the hardeſt places, the which they undertook: but e'er it was finiſhed, <hi>Fagius</hi> died of a Burning Fever; or as ſome ſay, was poiſoned by the Papiſts; ſo that <hi>anno</hi> 1550, he was intombed at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> from whence, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Papiſts (having condemn'd him for a Heretick) took his Bones, and burnt them. A poor, but malicious Revenge.</p>

And at that time an offer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made him by Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> he became his Chaplain, renouncing and deteſting againſt Popiſh Idolatries: he likewiſe often preached at <hi>Heidleberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt he ſtaid there, <hi>Luther</hi> came to that City, and preached ſeveral Sermons, diſputing againſt Popery, and alſo againſt Free Will; by which <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> greatly profited: and from that time forth he began to diſpute openly againſt the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in every place where he came; inſomuch that the Monks and Friars (fearing that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine might ſtir the people up to turn them out of their holes to work for their Livings, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things they moſt abhorred) laid wait for his life ſeveral times; but God ſtill preſerved his Servant. But he finding himſelf in danger, departed from that place, and after ſome time to <hi>Strasburg;</hi> where he no ſooner came, but he was appointed to preach in a Church, and read in the Divinity-School: and a while after the Reformed Miniſters, <hi>viz. Capito, Hedio, Zellius, Niger, Pollio,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57946:108"/>
Latomus, Firu, Hag</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> publiſhed their Reaſons, why they had changed the Maſs into the Lord's Supper; which Book they dedicated unto Prince <hi>Frederick,</hi> upon conſideration of which, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Strasburg</hi> baniſhed Popery out of their City.</p>
                  <p>A while after, <hi>Bucer</hi> diſputed with the Popiſh Doctors at <hi>Auſpurg,</hi> and proved their Religion falſe, out of the New Teſtament: ſo that his Fame ſpreading wide, he was ſent for by the Inhabitants of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> to come and reform their Churches; where he arriving, met with <hi>Occolampadius;</hi> they together ſo inſtructed the people, and ſet things in ſo good order, that the Churches flouriſhed in the truth for many years after.</p>
                  <p>By this time his Enemies had ſpread abroad a falſe rumor, that he had forſaken his New Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and made his Recantation: to clear which, he went to <hi>Zurick,</hi> and there in the full Aſſembly he confeſſed his Faith and Doctrine. Not long after, he went with ſome of his Brethren to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone,</hi> and there held a diſpute againſt <hi>Eccius,</hi> and ſeveral of the Popiſh Biſhops, aſſembled there for that purpoſe. A while after, the Emperor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Pope neglected to call a Council, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled ſome of the moderateſt of the Proteſtant Divines, as <hi>Agricola, Melancthon, Brentius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and commanded them to draw up a ſet form of Religion, which they did, but <hi>Bucer</hi> being ſent for by the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> refuſed to ſign the ſame, alledging that there were Popiſh Doctrines contained in it. As likewiſe ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers refuſed to ſign it upon the ſame account, which ſo inraged the Emperor, that he caſt ſeveral of them into priſon; but <hi>Bucer</hi> eſcaped his hands,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57946:108"/>
tho not without great peril. And in a ſhort time after was ſent for into <hi>England</hi> by Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who upon his arrival provided a Houſe for him at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and allowed him two hundred Crowns <hi>per annum;</hi> where he undertook with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> as is aforeſaid, the Tranſlation of the Bible; but by reaſon of the change of air and diet, he within a year after his coming over, fell ſick, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſo for ſome months, but in the end recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he taught in the Schools, and read Lectures in his own Houſe, but not taking care of himſelf, he fell again into a Relapſe the next day after he had commenced Doctor of Divinity.</p>
                  <p>During his ſickneſs many Learned Men came to viſit him, but eſpecially Doctor <hi>Bradford,</hi> who one day as he was taking leave of him to go preach, he told him that he would remember him in his Prayers, whereupon <hi>Bucer</hi> with tears in his eyes, ſaid, <hi>Caſt me not off, O Lord, now in my old age, when ſtrength faileth me.</hi> And a while after he ſaid, <hi>He hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me ſore; but he will never, never caſt me off.</hi> And being deſired to arm himſelf with faith, and a ſtedfaſt hope in God's Mercies againſt the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, He ſaid, <hi>I am wholly Chriſt's, and the Devil has nothing to do with me; and God forbid that I ſhould not now have experience of the ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in Chriſt.</hi> And thereupon with a ſmiling countenance he gave up the Ghoſt, and was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very nobly by the Commandment of the King.

                     <hi>JOhn Rogers,</hi> an Engliſh Man by birth, and born of Proteſtant Parents. In his youth he was educated at the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he learn'd the Tongues, and grew very expert in Learning; and being well grounded in Divinity, he was choſen by ſome Merchants to go with them, as their Chaplain, to <hi>Antwerp;</hi> where he no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er arrived, but he met <hi>Tindal,</hi> who was fled thither out of <hi>England,</hi> where he likewiſe brought him acquainted with ſeveral Divines of the Reformed Churches, with whom he had many Diſputes, and was ſo inlightened by their Doctrine, that he was ever after out of love with the Popiſh Religion, joyning with the Miniſters in tranſlating the Bible: he there likewiſe married a Wife, and then went to <hi>Wintenberg,</hi> where he ſo perfectly learned the Dutch Tongue, that he was choſen Teacher of a Congregation, where he faithfully performed his Charge, till ſuch time as King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth began his Reign; and then he was ſent for home by Doctor <hi>Ridley,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and by him made a Prebend of <hi>Pauls,</hi> where he preached the Goſpel till the beginning of Bloody Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign; yet in thoſe dangerous times he did not ſpare to exhort the people to adhere <hi>to the Goſpel and Doctrine they had received, and not to worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, as they had formerly done.</hi> And ſo went on to lay open the wicked practiſes of the Popiſh Clergy, which ſo nettled them, that they went and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57946:109"/>
complained to the Council, whereupon he was the next day ſent for, where he no ſooner came, but <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> (and then Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi>) fell to railing at him, calling him Impoſtor, Traitor and Heretick; and ſo charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he ſhould preach no more, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed.</p>
                  <p>Within a while after, the Queen put out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt preaching the Goſpel, after the wonted manner, ſhe having again introduced Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; but Doctor <hi>Rogers</hi> fearing <hi>to diſobey God more than man,</hi> could not be ſilent, but like a true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd fed his Flock with ſpiritual Food, by preaching as formerly; for which he being again brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, <hi>Gardiner</hi> ſent him priſoner to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Houſe; from whence, within a day or two he was ſent for by the Council the third time; but notwithſtanding he begged, that he might ſpeak for himſelf, and juſtifie his Doctrine, they would by no means permit him; but after many abuſive words given him, they remanded him to priſon, where he wrote a conſolary Letter to his Friends; in which he exhorted them, <q>To be ſtedfaſt, and to fight courageouſly under the Banner of their great Captain, the Lord Jeſus, againſt their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies; and that now it was no time to be faint-hearted, but freely to ſtand to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, and ſeal it with blood, which he was ready at all times to do.</q> After which he admoniſhed them to be careful of his Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p>The next day he was brought again before the Council, as likewiſe the day following, where he was treated with nothing but ill Language, which plainly demonſtrated they ſought his Life; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57946:110"/>
his refuſing to recant, without ſuffering him to make his defence, <hi>Gardiner</hi> read his Sentence, which was, <hi>That he being a notorious Heretick, ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into</hi> Smithfield, <hi>and there burnt.</hi> After which they proceeded to degrade him; and they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up to the Secular Power, in order to his Execution, declaring that he was under the great Curſe, and that it was a dangerous matter to eat or drink with him, or give him any thing; for that as many as did ſo were liable to the effects of the ſaid Curſe. To which Doctor <hi>Rogers</hi> with a ſmiling countenance ſaid, <hi>Well, my Lords, here I ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and you, and all this honorable Audience, and take him to witneſs, that I never wittingly, nor willingly taught any falſe Doctrine; and therefore have I a good Conſcience before God and all good men. I am ſure that you and I</hi> (meaning <hi>Gardiner) ſhall come before a righteous Judge, before whom I ſhall be as good a Man as you; and I nothing doubt, but I ſhall then be found a true Member of Jeſus Chriſt, and be everlaſtingly ſaved; and as for your falſe Church, you need not to have excommunicated me out of it; for I have not lived in it theſe twenty years. The Lord be thanked for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, he deſired that his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might come to him, whilſt he lived. But <hi>Gardiner</hi> would by no means conſent to his requeſt, ſo that he was hurryed to <hi>Newgate;</hi> when on the fourth of <hi>February</hi> the Keeper came to him, and told him, he muſt prepare for his Execution: at which he not being at all concerned, tho he had no warning before; only ſaid, <hi>Then if it be ſo, I need not tie my Points.</hi> Yet before he went to the Flames, he was carried before <hi>Bonner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who earneſtly perſwaded him to recant, and live; but he utterly refuſed life upon ſuch conditions,

exhorting ſuch as ſtood about him to repent and cleave faſt to Chriſt. As he came out, his Wife, with nine ſmall Children about her, and one ſucking at her breaſt, waited to ſee him, of which he took his leave, bidding them <hi>truſt in the Lord, and he would plentifully provide for them;</hi> after which, he went couragiouſly to the Stake, and with admirable pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, embraced the Flames, being the firſt that ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Teſtimony with his blood, during the Reign of that bloody Queen, ſuffering Martyrdom, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1555. he was a man of ſingular Eloquence, Learning and Wiſdom, by nature charitable and pitiful, of a middle ſtature, moderate in Diet, and powerful in Prayer.</p>

                     <hi>We declare no ſuch thing,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Saunders, but for that, let them take care whoſe Writings are yet abroad to teſtifie the ſame, not without great ſhame and reproach to the Author.</hi> This he ſaid, becauſe that <hi>Gardener</hi> to pleaſe King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, had written a Treatiſe, and cauſed it to be printed, wherein he declar'd Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Illegitimate, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, he told the Biſhop that he had done no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, unleſs it were one to preach God's Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purity and ſincerity of the Goſpel, and that although he and his Brethren were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to publiſh it with their Mouths, yet he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but that they were ready to ſeal it with their Blood; whereupon <hi>Gardener</hi> remanded him to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for which he thanked him, ſaying, that now he had appointed him a place to reſt in.</p>
                  <p>During his Impriſonment he wrote to his Wife and Friends, after this manner; <hi>I am merry, and I truſt I ſhall be ſo, mauger the teeth of all the Devils in Hell Riches I have none to beſtow amongſt you, but that Treaſure of taſting how ſweet Chriſt is to hungry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences (whereof I thank my Saviour I do feel part) that I bequeath to you, and to the reſt of my beloved in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57946:113"/>When he had continued in priſon about a year, his Friends began to ſue for his releaſe, the which when he heard of, he deſired them to deſiſt, for that it was God's pleaſure that he ſhould bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Teſtimony even to the death: A while after he was brought upon his Examination, where they offered to releaſe him, if he would recant, to which he replied, <hi>that he did confeſs Life and Liberty were things deſirable, but that he would not murther his Conſcience to ſave his Life, but by God's Grace,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I will abide the worſt extremity that man can do againſt me, rather than do any thing againſt my Conſcience;</hi> and when <hi>Gardener</hi> threatned him with death, he ſaid, <hi>Welcome be it whatſoever the will of the Lord be, either life or death, and I tell you truly I have learned to dye, but I exhort you to beware of ſhedding innocent blood, for truly it will cry aloud againſt you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After they had examined him, they proceeded to paſs Sentence againſt him, and then degrading him, they delivered him up to the Sheriffs to execute him by fire, when after a year and three Months impriſonment he was brought to the Stake, the which he firſt embraced, and afterwards kiſſing, ſaid, <hi>Welcome Croſs of Chriſt, welcome everlaſting life,</hi> the fire by the malice of his Enemies being made of green wood, put him to exquiſite torments, but he indured them with a Chriſtian patience, as being well aſſured when his fiery tryal was at an end, he ſhould receive a Crown of Life that fadeth not away.</p>
                  <p>He was burnt at <hi>Coventry, Anno Chriſti</hi> 1555. one thing by the way I ſhall not think amiſs to inſert, when the Nation was in ſuſpence for fear of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s bringing in Popery, Mr <hi>Saunders</hi> being in company with Doctor <hi>Pedleton,</hi> and ſeeming to be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57946:113"/>
much dejected, <hi>Pedleton</hi> ſaid, <hi>What man, there is much more cauſe for me no fear, than for you, for as much as I have a big and fat Body, yet will I ſee the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt drop of this Greaſe of mine melted away, and this Fleſh conſumed with fire, before I will forſake Jeſus Chriſt and his Truth which I have profeſſed;</hi> yet when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown, he turned Apoſtate.</p>
                  <p>By which we may ſee how weak the reſolves of men are, unleſs God's Holy Spirit aſſiſt them to perform and enable them to bear Affliction.</p>

                  <p>In the beginning of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, when the bloody cloud was juſt breaking over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was fetched up to <hi>London</hi> by a Purſivant, of whoſe coming although he was advertized, and by his Friends adviſed to make his Eſcape, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, ſaying, that he was not aſhamed of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, nor would he abandon Chriſt's Cauſe; for ſaid he, <hi>Once I muſt confeſs I did fly, but being called to this Place and Vocation, I am reſolved to ſtay, and live, and dy with my Sheep.</hi>

him, endeavouring to put him out, but when they ſaw they could not prove any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him (yet reſolving to have his Life) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Sentence againſt him, and then proceeded to degrade him and ſo delivered him to the Sheriff, who carried him to the Counter-Priſon in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> from whence a while after he was removed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> when in the way the Sheriff ſaid, <hi>Dr.</hi> Hooper, <hi>why was you ſo raſh as to anſwer my Lord Chancellor ſo haſtily, it might have happened better to you, had you mollified him with mild Words.</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>I ſpoke nothing unbeſeeming me, neither was I impatient, though I was earneſt in my Maſter's Cauſe, and it ſtands me in ſtead ſo to be, for it goeth upon life and death, not only in this World, but in the World to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had continued Six Days in <hi>Newgate,</hi> the Keeper brought him word, that he was to be carried to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> there to ſuffer at the Stake; at which News he greatly rejoyced, giving praiſe to God that he had ſo graciouſly diſpoſed his Enemies hearts, to carry him to a Place where he had ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taught, that there he might ſeal his Doctrine with his Blood. Then came to him ſeveral of the Popiſh Sadduces, as <hi>Bonner, Harpsfield,</hi> and others, to intreat him to accept of life, by renouncing his former Doctrine, and making his Publick Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he would by no means hearken unto them, ſaying, <hi>He would not for cowardly fear forſake his Lord and Maſter, but be ſtedfaſt to the end, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that he would ſend him patience and ſtrength to withſtand the utmoſt torments their rage could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi>

                  <p>Within a while after he was taken out of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> to be carried to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> in order to his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

when as all the way he went he appeared very joyful, and lying one Night by the way, he eat his Supper with a merry countenance, and ſlept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt trouble; for why, he was all peace within, as being armed with a good Conſcience, which is the only true happineſs during this mortal life; the next Morning Sir <hi>Anthony Kingſton</hi> came to him and told him, that he would adviſe him to ſubmit himſelf to the Church by a free Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for, ſays he, <hi>Life is ſweet.</hi> To which, he replied, <hi>But the death to come is more bitter, and the life to come far ſweeter, and I will rather dye than renounce my Lord and Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being come to the Verge of the County, he was received by the Sheriff, who with a ſtrong Guard conveyed him to the Place of Execution, being met by many thouſands of People, who much bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his condition, and ſent up their Prayers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he might be comforted and inabled to bear his ſufferings patiently, many of them weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee ſo Reverend a Perſon fallen into ſuch miſery; but he comforted them, and told them, <hi>That he was unworthy who refuſed to ſuffer reproach or death for the ſake of the Lord Jeſus, who refuſed not for our ſakes to ſuffer a ſhameful and ignominious death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs;</hi> and hereupon he began to exhort them to be ſtedfaſt in their Faith, but the Popiſh Varlets would not ſuffer him to proceed. Then he addreſſed himſelf to the Sheriff, ſaying, <hi>Sir my requeſt to you is, that I may have a quick fire, which may ſoon diſpatch me, and I will be as obedient as you would wiſh, I might have had my life with great advancement, as to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, but I am willing to offer my life for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Truth, and truſt to dye a faithful Servant to God, and a true Subject to the Queen.</hi>

                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57946:116"/>Then the Sheriff told him that he had ſtrict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to hinder him from ſpeaking to the People, to which he ſaid <hi>God's will be done,</hi> and then kneeling down, he continued in fervent Prayer for the ſpace of half an hour with an exalted and joyful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and then riſing up, ſuffered them to faſten him to the Stake, where ſuch was the malice of his Enemies, that they had prepared green wood, yet before the fire was kindled, a Pardon was offered, if he would recant; but he cryed out with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Zeal, <hi>If you love my Soul, away with it,</hi> and then three Iron Hoops being brought to faſten him to the Stake, he ſaid, <hi>If you had brought none of theſe, I would have ſtood patiently,</hi> and thereupon he only took one of them, and put it about his middle. When the Reeds were ſet up, he embraced &amp; kiſſed them, putting them under his Arms, where he had two Bags of Gunpowder, and the fire being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he continued three quarters of an hour in the fire, praying, and often crying out, <hi>O Jeſus thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>have mercy upon my Soul,</hi> and often between whiles he would deſire them to let the fire come at him, the which as is above mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of green Wood, conſumed all his lower parts, when as the upper remained untouched, yet he bore it patiently, not in the leaſt complaining of his Torments, as being paſt doubt ſupported by him that is able to make all things tolerable; thus fell this bleſſed Martyr in the bloody Perſecution under Queen <hi>Mary, Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1555.

Then ſaid <hi>Bonner, If you will not I ſhall make you ere I go. By Gods Grace,</hi> ſaid <hi>Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>you ſhall not.</hi> Then <hi>Bonner</hi> charged him to do it upon his obedience. But upon his abſolute refuſing to meddle with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Trumpery, <hi>Bonner</hi> Commanded his man to do it; who put them on accordingly. Then Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſetting his Arms to his ſides walked a turn or two, ſaying: <hi>Now my Lord were I in Cheapſide, what a goodly Fool ſhould I be counted, would not the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Boys laugh at theſe Ridiculous Toys?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At which the Biſhop being angry, went about to ſtrike him, but his Chaplain deſired him not, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he would ſurely ſtrike again. Yes by my Faith,</hi> ſaid Dr. <hi>Taylor, wou'd I, for the Cauſe is Chriſts, and I were no good Chriſtian if I would not fight in my Maſters quarrel.</hi> Then the Biſhop not daring to proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Curſed him, and departed. To which Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> replyed, <hi>Though you do Curſe me, yet God does bleſs me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The night before his being carried to <hi>Hadly</hi> to be burned, his Wife, Children, and Servants were permitted to come to him, with whom he prayed very fervently, and gave them all his Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning the Sheriff received him at the Priſon, he going very joyfully; and by the way he was greatly ſolicited by the Sheriff of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57946:119"/>
and embrace the Popiſh Religion. To which he only Anſwered, <hi>Well, I perceive that I now have been deceived my ſelf, and ſhall deceive many in</hi> Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>of their Expectations.</hi> At which the Sheriff told him it was a gracious ſaying, and deſired him to explain it, as well hoping he intended to recant. Why, ſaid Dr. <hi>Taylor, I did propoſe to my ſelf once, that I ſhould have been buryed in</hi> Hadly <hi>Church yard, in which I now ſee I ſhall be deceived, and as for my deceiving of others of their Expectations, is, that I being a man of a Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent body, might have fed many Worms, who now muſt be Content without me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He being come within two miles of <hi>Hadly,</hi> a great number of People came flocking to meet him, for the moſt part greatly lamenting the State into which he was fallen; when as he Comforted them in the beſt manner, Saying, <hi>be Patient, as for me, I thank God I am almoſt at home, and have not paſt two miles more to go over, before I come to my Fathers houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the Towns end a poor Lame man with five ſmall Children met him, and cryed out; <hi>Ah! dear Father, and good Shepherd Dr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>God help and Comfort thee, as thou haſt many times ſuccoured and Comforted me, and my poor Children:</hi> Whilſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others with weeping Eyes lamented his loſs.</p>
                  <p>When he came to the Alms-houſes he called out the poor People by their names, as he was at other times accuſtomed, and gave mony to every one of them, who Prayed to God to ſtrengthen and Comfort him, greatly lamenting the loſs of ſo good a Benefactor as he was wont to be.</p>
                  <p>Coming to the place of Execution, the Sheriff commanded him that he ſhould in no wiſe ſpeak to the people; which did not a little grieve him; that he was not ſuffered to take his laſt farewel of thoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57946:119"/>
to whom he had ſo faithfully Preached the Goſpel: yet he was very Cheerful, when after he had Prayed a while, he put off his Cloaths and went to the Stake and kiſſed it, when through the vehemency of the Zeal by which his Soul was agitated, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to ſpeak one thruſt a Staff-into his mouth, and by that means hindered him; another ſtruck him over the Head; and a third threw a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got at him, which ſo cut his Face that the Blood ran down in abundance; upon which he ſaid, <hi>O Friend, what needed this? I have harm enough already.</hi> And when he was ſaying his <hi>Miſerere</hi> in Engliſh, Sr. <hi>John Shelton</hi> ſtruck him on the mouth, ſaying, <hi>Knave I will make you ſpeak Latine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the fire was kindled, he extended his Arms toward Heaven, and with a voyce as if he had been Raviſhed with Joy, continued ſaying, <hi>Moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father of Heaven, for Jeſus Chriſt my Saviours ſake, receive my Soul into thy Hands,</hi> till one with a Halbert beat out his Brains. And thus dyed this Bleſſed Martyr, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1555.</p>

                     <hi>JOhn Bradford</hi> was born of Vertuous Parents at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and brought up in ſuch Learning as the place was able to afford, and when he had greatly profitted therein, he became Steward to Sr. <hi>John Harrington,</hi> with whom he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57946:120"/>
in much Credit for ſeveral years, yet his mind not being contented with that manner of Life, but ſtill fixed upon Divine matters, he left his Maſter and went to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where he ſo profited in the ſtudy of Divinity, that within two years after his coming thither, he commenced Maſter of Arts, and was choſen a fellow of <hi>Pembrook-Hall:</hi> Where he lived in good repute a Conſiderable time, and there happened to come acquained with <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> (who to avoid the ſtorms of Perſecution in <hi>Germany,</hi> was come over into <hi>England</hi>) and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him he greatly profited, inſomuch that Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> hearing of his towardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holy manner of Life, preferred him to be a Prebend of St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> where he continued faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcharge his Truſt, till the beginning of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign: when as one <hi>Bourn</hi> Chaplain to <hi>Bonner,</hi> and afterward made Biſhop of <hi>Bath,</hi> Preaching at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs ſo highly offended the People in his Sermon, by inveighing againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, That not only a Dagger was thrown at him, but likewiſe the People began ſo far to Mutinie, that had not Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> at his Earneſt requeſt ſtood up in his place and quieted the People, they had pulled the Popiſh Wolf in pieces; but the People no ſooner perceiving <hi>Bradford</hi> but they gave a great ſhout, <hi>Crying, Bradford, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, God ſave thy Life Bradford?</hi> Yet <hi>Bourn</hi> not thinking himſelf ſafe deſired Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> to convey him out of the Throng, which he did, ſheltring him with his own Body, and ſpreading his Gown over him, in his retreat into St. <hi>Pauls</hi> School where he left him. Then cryed the People, <hi>Ah! Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thou haſt ſaved him, that will be the forwardeſt to burn thee.</hi> As indeed he was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57946:120"/>On the ſame day in the Afternoon Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> Preached at <hi>Bow</hi> Church, and in his Sermon ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved ſuch tumultuous Proceedings; yet within three days after he was ſent for by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel and charged as a ſtirrer up of Sedition; and thereupon ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whence he was removed to the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> from thence he was brought ſeveral times before <hi>Bonner</hi> to be Examined, and ever put the Biſhop to a non plus; yet his Death being reſolved upon, the bloody Wretch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſs Sentence upon him, as likewiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade him, and then Committed him to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> where he continued a Conſiderable time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Execution, Preaching to and Exhorting the Priſoners, in the way of ſaving Knowledge, as likewiſe relieving their wants according to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: Nor was there a day paſſed wherein ſome Perſon or other of quality did not come to him for Inſtructions, inſomuch that his Chamber ſeemed rather a Chappel ſet apart for Divine worſhip, then an impriſonment; for there he Preached twice every Sabbath, and prayed with ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither every day, and as often as he could have opportunity he adminiſtred the Sacrament in both kinds. He was a man ſo juſt that the Keeper of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> would permit him upon his word to go into <hi>London</hi> and viſit his Friends, and he was ever ſo Faithful that he rather returned before, then after the time he had ſet.</p>
                  <p>When his Friends demanded whether they ſhould ſolicite his Delivery, and what he would do if he had his Liberty, his Anſwer was; <hi>That he did not greatly Care whether he was delivered or not, but if it ſo happened he would Marry and live ſecretly in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. During his Impriſonment, many Spaniſh Fryers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57946:121"/>
came to tempt him to renounce his Religion, but he uſed ſuch powerful Arguments to confirm it to be the true Religion, ſuch as was eſtabliſhed in the Primitive Church by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſo confounded them in their own Arguments, that they were always obliged to betake themſelves to their old ſhift, which was to Rail and brand him with the name of Heretick.</p>
                  <p>He often had the opportunity to eſcape, but he would by no means attempt it; the night before he was conveyed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he had a dream wherein it was ſignified to him, <hi>That he was to be burnt within two days, that Chains were brought, and that the day following he was to go to Newgate;</hi> The which happened accordingly, for he was ſcarce riſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Keepers wife came to him, and told him ſhe had heavy news to inform him, which is, ſaid ſhe, <hi>that you muſt preſently go to Newgate, where your Chains are ready, in Order to your being burnt in Smithfield,</hi> at which he taking off his Cap lifted up his Eyes toward Heaven, and ſaid, <hi>I thank God for it, I have looked for the day a long time: It comes not now to me ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, but as a thing that I have waited for with Patience, the Lord make me worthy to ſuffer for his Name.</hi> And thereupon he prayed fervently for a good ſpace, when as the Officers were come to fetch him, at which time he called together the Priſoners, and Servants, giving them many pious Exhortations, and diſtributed Monies amongſt them, bidding them perſevere in the Truth, <hi>And not be carried away with every Wind of Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſeveral came to viſit him, to whom he gave Ghoſtly Conſolation. And the next morning the Sheriff came for him, and conveyed him together with a youth of about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57946:121"/>
years of Age to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where the Stake was prepared. When he came at the Stake, he kiſſed it, as likewiſe a Faggot that he took up, and then falling flat upon his Face, in token of Humility, he prayed for a good ſpace, till the Sheriff ordered him to riſe; they putting off his Raiment, he was together with the Youth faſtned to the Stake, when as he cryed with a loud voice, <hi>Repent, O</hi> England, <hi>of thy ſins, beware of Idolatry, beware of falſe Anti-Chriſts, take heed they do not deceive thee.</hi> Then turning to the young man, who was an Apprentice to a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Be of good Comfort Brother, for we ſhall have a merry Supper with the Lord this Night.</hi> And then embracing the Reeds, he ſaid, <hi>Streight is the way, and narrow is the gate that leadeth unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and few there be that find it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fire being kindled, he held his hands in the flames, and with a Chriſtian patience ſuffered the burning without ſo much as ſtirring the body, dying a glorious Martyr, in the Bloody year, <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. He was a man ſo intirely beloved for his holy life, that many who never ſaw him, greatly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his death; nay, the very Papiſts themſelves, in the midſt of all their rage and malice, were forced to confeſs that he was a man of great Learning, and many of them heartily wiſhed that he might have lived.</p>

                  <head>The Life of <hi>NICHOLAS RIDLEY</hi> Martyr.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>NIcholas Ridley</hi> was Born at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and there Educated in Learning by his pious Parents, till he was fitted for the Univerſity, when as he was ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he grew ſo famous by his Studies in Divinity, that by the conſent of the whole Univerſity he was choſen Maſter of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi> Hall, and commenced Doctor in Divinity.</p>
                  <p>A while after Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> hearing of his Fame, ſent for him, and made him Vicar of <hi>Hern</hi> in Eaſt <hi>Kent,</hi> where he ſo well diſcharged his Paſtoral Office, that he gained the general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of all the Places adjacent, who neglecting their own Teacher, would for many miles circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference come to hear his Sermons; ſo that in a while after he was conſtituted a Prebend of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but not greatly like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe with whom he was obliged to converſe with, in that Station he left them, and travelled into <hi>France,</hi> where after his having viſited many Places, and greatly profited in his Studies, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>England,</hi> where he was no ſooner come, but King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth ſent for him, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him one of His Chaplains; as likewiſe within a while after made him Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in which Station he continued till the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, who tranſlated him to the See of <hi>London,</hi> where he continued preaching and inſtructing the People by expounding the Scriptures, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them unfeignedly to imbrace the Reformed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57946:122"/>
Religion, by utterly renouncing Popiſh Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Idolatries, and ſo by preaching from Church to Church throughout his Dioceſs. His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Enemies, the Papiſts, were obliged to confeſs he was a man of a pious Life and Converſation; never did he preach, but ſuch multitudes of People came flocking about him, that the Church could not contain them, and thus cotinued he in great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit till the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in whoſe days all things Sacred were tumbled down, and the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Deſolation ſet up in the Holy Places.</p>
                  <p>This good Biſhop was firſt converted to the true Religion, by reading <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtrongly confirmed in his opinion, by converſing with <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and other Learned Divines of the Reformed Church; when in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, he was ſent for before the Council, and there accuſed of ſpreading Heretical Doctrine. To which Accuſation, although he anſwered with all Gravity, and oppoſed it with many learned Arguments; yet was he ſent to the Tower, and there continued till he, Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lattimer</hi> were ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> there to diſpute againſt the Popiſh Doctors; after which Diſpute they were all three committed to Priſon in that City, till at laſt Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from the reſt, and ſent to the houſe of one Mr. <hi>Iriſh,</hi> where he remained till the day he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Martyrdom; yet he often converſed by Letters with the aforeſaid holy men, as likewiſe with Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> who was at the ſame time a Priſoner in the King's Bench; when writing to Dr. <hi>Lattimer,</hi> he deſires him that he would ſend him continually ſome Spiritual Conſolations; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>unleſs the Lord aſſiſt me in his Service, I ſhall but play the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57946:123"/>
part of a Coward; but he can make a Coward in his Cauſe fight like a couragious Soldier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He confeſſed that upon hearing the reſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and laſt Speech of Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> who ſuffered Martyrdom, he was greatly incouraged, and felt all the heavineſs that before oppreſſed his Soul, quite removed, ſo that he was all Joy and Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, he being brought into Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s Church, where by the Queen's Appointment, he was to be tryed (as they termed it, although his death was reſolved on before, right or wrong) by ſuch Commiſſioners as were come thither for that purpoſe, amongſt whom one ſat as repreſenting the Pope; when he was come they opened their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and began to read it, to which he gave heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Attention, till ſuch time as they came to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pope and his Supremacy, and then he put on his Hat, ſaying, <hi>I do not this in contempt to any Perſon here, but to the Pope, whoſe uſurped Supremacy I ſhould make my ſelf guilty of owning, if I ſhould with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vail my Cap at the hearing it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this Speech, the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> chafed exceedingly, and commanded the Beadle to take off his Cap, which he meekly ſuffered him to do, when after a long Examination, but no Proof againſt him of any Erroneous Doctrine, as they pretended, they proceeded to read his Sentence of Condemnation; and in a ſhort time after the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> came to degrade him, bringing the Maſſing Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, which he would have had him put on, but he refuſed. Then the Biſhop with the help of his men put them on him, and ſo taking them off again, pronounced him an Excommunicated and Accurſed Perſon, declaring that it was dangerous for any to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57946:123"/>
converſe with him. Yet Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> laught at the Bug-bear threats, remembring the words of the Apoſtle, who ſays, <hi>If our Conſcience accuſe us not, God that is greater than our Conſcience will not condemn us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Degradation, he was delivered over to the Secular Power, in order to his Execution, when at Supper-time his Keeper's Wife weeping to think he muſt ſuffer the next day; he comforted her, ſaying, <hi>I pray you be patient and chearful, as I am, for by this grief you expreſs, 'tis plain you love us not;</hi> and thereupon he with a chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance invited them all to his Wedding, ſaying, <hi>to morrow ſhall I be married,</hi> ſpeaking myſtically, as meaning his Soul was to be eſpouſed to Chriſt its Redeemer, and when his Brother-in-Law and others offered to watch with him, he refuſed their kindneſs, ſaying, that he ſhould ſleep as well that night as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he did in his life.</p>
                  <p>When the Morning was come, the Sheriff, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Lord <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Thame,</hi> and others, came with a great Guard to convey him to the Place of Execution; as alſo Dr. <hi>Lattimer,</hi> who was condemned with him, as in his life will hereafter appear; when as Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> dreſſed himſelf in his Epiſcopal Garments, as many of them as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and ſhaved himſelf, as if he had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an earthly Wedding, and as he was upon his way, he looking behind him, eſpied Dr. <hi>Lattimer</hi> coming after, and called to him with a chearful voice, ſaying, <hi>O Brother, are you there? Yes,</hi> ſaid Dr. <hi>Lattimore, have after you as faſt as I can.</hi> When they came to the Place of Execution, Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted upon a Stool, ſet for that purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rail againſt them to the People, telling them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57946:124"/>
that they were <hi>Zuinglians, Occolampadians,</hi> and the worſt of Hereticks. Upon which Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees, and beſought the Lord <hi>Williams, for Chriſt Jeſus ſake that he might have liberty to anſwer him, and clear himſelf of thoſe Scandals before he dyed;</hi> but the Vice-Chancellor and others, run to him and ſtopped his mouth, ſaying, <hi>If he would recant he ſhould be heard, but not otherwiſe. Then,</hi> ſaid Dr. <hi>Ridley, I will never deny my Lord Jeſus, and his known Truth, whilſt I have breath in my body.</hi> Then turning to Dr. <hi>Lattimer,</hi> he embraced him, and bid him be of good comfort; <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>God will either aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the heat of the fire, or give us ſtrength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure its fury with patience,</hi> and ſo going to the Stake, he kiſſed it, and then kneeled down, and prayed fervently for a good ſpace. When riſing up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to ſpeak to the People, the Popiſh Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſt run and ſtopped his mouth.</p>
                  <p>When he was ſtripped, and the Fagots were piling about him, he ſaid, <hi>O Heavenly Father, I give thee thanks for that thou haſt called me to be a Profeſſor of thee even unto death, I beſeech thee, O Lord God, have mercy upon this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and deliver it from all its Enemies.</hi> And when the Smith was knocking in the Staple that faſtned the Chain, he ſaid, <hi>I pray thee good fellow drive it in faſt, for the Fleſh will have its courſe.</hi> Then did his Brother-in-Law bring him a bag of Gunpowder, which he received joyfully, and tyed it about his Neck, ſo the fire being kindled, he ſtood in the flame a long while before he dyed, by reaſon of the ill making of the fire, and then, ſaying, <hi>Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my Spirit, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Soul,</hi> he gave up the Ghoſt, ſuffering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1555. He was a man of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Piety and Learning, juſt to all, giving no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57946:124"/>
of abuſe to any. Charitable he was even to a a Miracle, for he kept <hi>Bonners</hi> Mother at his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and when he came to dye, he ſaid, <hi>Nothing troubled him, but that ſeveral Poor men had taken Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of him, and paid their Mony whilſt he ſat Biſhop of</hi> London, <hi>which were now taken from them without any Recompence;</hi> and therefore he deſired the Lord <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> to be a means for them, to the Queen, that they might not loſe their Mony. If ten thouſand Pounds could have ſaved his Life, the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> offered as much; but his cruel Adverſaries thirſted after nothing more then his Blood; nor would Queen <hi>Mary</hi> hearken to any Supplication, that was made for his Life, although he in King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>ſixth</hi>'s time, ſtood againſt moſt of the Peers and Clergy, when they went to exclude her from the Succeſſion; nor would he for any Intreaty ſet his hand to it.</p>
                  <p>One thing is worthy of Note, and may be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Prophecy, which was this; Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> during his being Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> long before King <hi>Edwards</hi> Death: As he was Croſſing the Thames in a Boat, the Wind aroſe ſo high that all that were with him were in fear of preſent drowning; but he Comforted them ſaying, <hi>Fear not for this Boat carries a Biſhop that muſt be burned, and not drowned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much for the Life of this Pious Martyr, who did not only oppoſe to the utmoſt, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and Idolatries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by words but alſo in Writing, and at laſt ſealed his Teſtimony with his Blood.</p>

                     <hi>H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gh Latimer</hi> was born in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> at a place called <hi>Thrikeſſon,</hi> where in his younger years he was put to School, and profited ſo much in learning, that within a while he was ſent to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where he gave himſelf wholly to the Study of Divinity, and within two years after his coming thither, Commenced Batchelor of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet was he ſo zealous a Papiſt, till God opened his eyes that he wrote many bitter Letters againſt <hi>Melancthone,</hi> and others of the Reformed Church, uſing all the Idolatrous Ceremonies; counting it a great Crime in him if he omitted any one part of the Romiſh Decrees, and <hi>Canons</hi> reſolving by any means to become a Fryer, for he at that time verily believed that if he were ſo he could not be Damned; ſo blinded was he with Superſtition, and plunged ſo far into Error; but God having made him, <hi>a choſen Veſſel to bear his Name,</hi> ſoon found means for his Converſion; for Mr. <hi>Biliney</hi> an orthodox Divine taking notice of his great Zeal, in the way he then was in, and for the Religion (though a falſe one) that he profeſſed, he took ſuch opportunities to diſcourſe with him in Private, that by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments he ſo far wrought upon him, as to give heedful Attention to his Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſoon became more Tractable, and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the reformed Church; and greatly grieved
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57946:125"/>
for the abuſes he had offered to the reformed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, asking them both by word of mouth, and Letters forgiveneſs for the offences. And now his Eyes being open he plainly perceived the deceits of the Romiſh Church, and began to deteſt it, as much as he ever had admired it, ſo that he by that means fell into the high Diſpleaſure of ſome Romiſh Doctors, who before had ſtyled him their Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>When he was thus Converted and brought over to imbrace the ſaving Knowledge of the Goſpel, he began to Preach and indeavour to Convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, inſomuch that he converted many; but the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> ſent ſtrictly to forbid him; but upon his refuſing to deſiſt the Biſhop went himſelf, when as he found him Preaching, which he continued ſo Authentickly and with ſuch a Grace, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop inſtead of reproving him, highly Commended him, and wiſhed to God that himſelf had the ſame Gift of preaching ſo plain and powerfully, yet ſhortly after a complaint was made againſt him, to Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> who cited him before him; but by the means of Dr. <hi>Butts</hi> the King's Phyſician, he was rather advanced then any ways Diſcouraged; for it being about the time that the debate was held about King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his Supremacy, the Cardinal upon finding a man of great Learning, choſe him to be one of thoſe that ſate about the deciding that Affair; when within a while he grew into ſuch favour with the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to a Benefice in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> where he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Officiated for many years, and then was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo well, that he ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Praiſe of all that were under his Cure.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57946:126"/>
Unleſs ſome malicious Fryers and Monks, who great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Envyed him as plainly perceiving, that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tended to the diſcovery of their abominable Errors; inſomuch that they Exhibited many griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Complaints againſt him. How that he Preached falſe Doctrine, and indeavoured to ſtir up the people to Rebellion. But to this he ſo learnedly returned Anſwer, that his Adverſaries were aſhamed of what they had done; then continued he more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent then ever, in Correcting and reforming ſuch Abuſes as were crept into the ſeveral Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his jurisdiction, oppoſing, as much as in him lay, the Croſs abſurdities of the popiſh Prieſts, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Miracles and Tranſubſtantiation, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images, and the like, which made the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Papiſts ever lay Snares for him, but in vain; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Life of the worthy Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> they prevailed not in any thing.</p>
                  <p>Upon New-years day, when the Biſhops were wont to preſent the King with Gifts, Dr. <hi>Latimer</hi> preſented King <hi>Henry</hi> with a New Teſtament, in a Handkerchief, with this Inſcription on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>Fornicatores, &amp; Adulteros, Judicabit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> Whoremongers, and Adulterers, God will judg; ſo plain was he in reproving the King, when none beſides him durſt Attempt it.</p>
                  <p>A while after by the prevalency of the popiſh Lords, they obtained a Bill to paſs in Parliament, containing the ſix bloody Articles, which obliged many a good man, to lay down his Charge, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt this good Biſhop. When he had pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Rocket before ſeveral of his Friends, he cut a Caper or two, Saying; <hi>now I feel my ſelf light, as being diſcharged of a heavy Burthon,</hi> for indeed ſuch a Charge is not a little ponderous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57946:126"/>
If according to the Inſtitution of Biſhops, they faithfully diſcharge their Truſt.</p>
                  <p>When he had reſigned his Biſhoprick, he retired himſelf to weſt <hi>Kingſton</hi> near <hi>Briſtow,</hi> where he had a Perſonage, and there he Preached every Sunday, Exhorting and inſtructing the People in the way to eternal Life. Yet here the reſtleſs Papiſts would not ſuffer him to be at quiet, but made great Complaints againſt his Doctrine, although they could prove nothing therein contrary to the Word of God; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he repairing to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to clear himſelf, found ſuch Favour at his Hands, that he prevailed with the King ſo far on his behalf, that his Accuſers were forced to draw in their Horns and ſhrink into their ſhells again, as well knowing they could make out nothing Erroneous, againſt either himſelf, or his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were his Conflicts during the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, but he dying, and young King <hi>Edward</hi> coming to the Crown, the ſix Articles that had cauſed ſuch Blood-ſhed, were Rovoked, and then Dr. <hi>Latimer</hi> was reſtored to his Biſhoprick, where he continued to Preach twice aday for the moſt part. And now the Popes Chickens not having ſuch ſhelter under the Wings of this good Prince; as they had before, the Biſhop lived in great quiet, and followed his Studies ſo cloſe, that he ſoon became ſuch a Diſputant that few durſt encounter him.</p>
                  <p>One day as he was Preaching, he told his Auditory, <hi>that his Preaching the Goſpel would one day coſt him his Life, and that</hi> Wincheſter <hi>was preſerved in the</hi> Tower <hi>for the ſame purpoſe;</hi> which in the Reign of Bloody Queen <hi>Mary</hi> fell out accordingly, for ſhe was no ſooner ſeated in the Throne, but a Purſevant was ſent to fetch Dr. <hi>Latimer</hi> up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57946:127"/>
Of whoſe coming altho he had ſix days notice before hand, yet would he not avoid him, but having received the Letters he brought from the Council, he promiſed to follow him, which he did the next day, tho contrary to the Expectation of his Enemies, who wiſhed that he would fly, as well knowing his great Parts; but he taking leave of his Friends, ſaid, <hi>I now go as willing to give an Account of my Faith, as ever I yet went to any place, doubting not, but that God who hath made me worthy to Preach his Word before two excellent Princes will enable me to bear Witneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third, either to her Eternal Comfort or Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> In his way to Court he Rid through <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> where he ſaid to ſuch as accompanied him: <hi>That</hi> Smithfield <hi>had groaned for him a long time.</hi> When he came before the Councel, they fell to abuſing him after an unſeemly manner, and without ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſpeak for himſelf, ſent him Priſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> which they had reſolved upon before his coming.</p>
                  <p>Being in the <hi>Tower,</hi> God gave him not only a Chriſtian patience, but indued him with the Spirit of wiſdom, beyond what he had formerly been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. There he kept a whole Winter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fire, notwithſtanding his age, and the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Weather, which made him tell the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants man, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs they looked better after him, he ſhould deceive them:</hi> Which words he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Maſter, the Lieutenant charged Dr. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> as one intending to make his eſcape. But he expounded the Words, ſaying, <hi>That unleſs you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide me fire and other neceſſaries, inſtead of dying by heat</hi> (meaning by burning) <hi>I ſhall periſh here, through Cold and want.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had continued a conſiderable time Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57946:127"/>
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and had been often tempted to Recant, he was ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> together with Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> there to Diſpute againſt the Popiſh Doctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Tranſubſtantiation, and other ſuch like Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Tenets in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Where Dr. <hi>Weſton</hi> was appointed Prolocutor: The Place for the Diſpute being St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Church. And altho theſe three Champions of Chriſt were ſeparated, not being allowed the uſe of Books, yet did they ſo Confound their Adverſaries by lively Texts out of the Scriptures, and Proofs out of the Fathers, that they were obliged to fall to their old way of Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo overpow'ring them with Noiſe and Clamor, they gave out to the Rabble that they had prevailed againſt the Hereticks, but would by no means ſuffer the Proceedings to be Publiſhed. Then was our good Biſhop with the reſt conveyed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Priſons, where he continued with admirable Patience, writing to his fellow-Sufferers to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Strengthen them to bear their Croſs: And often in his Prayer, which was exceeding Fervent, he would beg of God to reſtore the Light of the Goſpel once more in <hi>England,</hi> and that he would preſerve Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to be a Comfort to the People: And for himſelf, he deſired to dye, <hi>That he ſo might ſeal his Teſtimony with his deareſt Blood.</hi> All which came afterwards to paſs.</p>
                  <p>A while after he was brought to his Tryal, where he ſo defended the Doctrine he had Preached, that his Enemies were amazed at his prodigious Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Yet his Death, being right or wrong, reſolved upon, they proceeded to degrade, and Sentence him: After which he was delivered up to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power, in order to his Execution, together with Dr. <hi>Ridley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57946:128"/>When he was brought to the Stake, he look'd with a very chearful Countenance, as not being in the leaſt Diſmayed at the Approach of that Death which himſelf ſo much deſired, and the which he might have avoided, if he would have Recanted. After he had prayed a while, he unſtripp'd himſelf for the Fire, and ſaid to Biſhop <hi>Ridley, Brother, be of good Comfort, and play the Man; for I truſt by God's Grace, we ſhall this Day light ſuch a Candle in</hi> England <hi>as ſhall never be put out:</hi> Adding that <hi>He knew God was Faithful, and would not ſuffer him to be Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above what he was able to bear.</hi> Then Embracing Dr. <hi>Ridley,</hi> he was bound to the Stake, and the Fire kindled to him, when as he cryed with a loud Voice; <hi>O Father of Heaven, receive my Soul:</hi> And then ſtroaking his Face with his Hand, he gave up the Ghoſt; dying a Glorious Martyr at <hi>Oxford, Anno Chriſti</hi> 1555.</p>
                  <p>Two things more are worthy of Note. The firſt is, That at his Death ſuch abundance of Blood guſhed out, that it for a while damped the Fire: The ſecond, That <hi>Stephen Gardener</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> his mortal Enemy, having that Day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a great Feaſt at <hi>Wincheſter-Houſe</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark;</hi> notwithſtanding his having ſeveral Perſons of Quality to Dine with him, would not go to Dinner till ſuch time as he received certain Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Deaths of <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Ridley,</hi> which was not till about four in the Afternoon; when with a chearful Countenance he ſaid, <hi>Come now my Lords ſit down, the arch-Hereticks are Diſpatched.</hi> But he had not eat paſt three Bits before his Tongue began to ſwell in his Mouth. So that being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed from the Table, as not being able to go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he continued in a miſerable Condition for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57946:128"/>
fifteen Days, and then dyed, being as ſome Report, Starved by reaſon he could not ſwallow any Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

                  <head>The Life of <hi>THOMAS CRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and Martyr.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THomas Cranmer</hi> was born of a very worſhipful Family, at <hi>Arſelacthon</hi> in <hi>Notinghamſhire,</hi> where he was Educated in ſuch Learning as his tender Years were capable to receive; and when he grew to more Perfection, he was ſent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where he ſo profited in his Studies, that he was within three Years after his coming thither, made a Fellow of <hi>Jeſus Colledg:</hi> But by reaſon of his marrying a Wife, that Place was ſequeſtred from him, and he appointed Divinity Reader in <hi>Buckingham Colledg,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo well, that he got the good Will of the Heads of the Univerſity: So that his Wife dying, he was Re-inveſted in his former Place; where he had not been long, before he Commenced Dr. of Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Within a while after, Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> having Founded a new Colledg in <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſought for the moſt Learned Men in the Kingdom to repleniſh it, amongſt whom <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Choſen: But he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57946:129"/>
that <hi>Woolſey</hi>'s Fall was at hand, would by no Means imbrace the Offer, but kept in his former Station.</p>
                  <p>About this time King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight being deſirous to be Divorced from <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had been formerly Married to his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> had long laboured in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to effect his Purpoſe; but after great Trouble, and much Mony ſpent, nothing was done therein; Inſomuch that the King was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly troubled. When ſo it happened that <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Gardiner,</hi> the former being the King's Almoner, and the latter his Secretary, being at <hi>Waltham,</hi> where the Court at that time reſided: They one Day invited <hi>Cranmer</hi> to Dine with them, who was come thither from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for fear of the Plague, which raged much in that Univerſity. When in the midſt of their Feaſting, they demanded his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion touching the King's Affair, in Relation to the Divorce. To whom he made this modeſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I cannot ſay much on the ſuddain, in ſo weighty a Buſineſs, which requires conſiderable Study and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: But in my Opinion, ſeeing the King lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Preſſure of Mind, and is in great Trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nothing can be more grievous than long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and wandering in Romiſh Suits, in which, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are once Intangled, can hardly get out of the Snares: Wherefore I think it better, that laying aſide all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and Court Suits, wherein the King has been ſo long toſſed with great Afflictions of Mind: The Judgment of Divines both in our own, and forrain Nations, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities be ſearched out, and required, which may be ſtrengthened with the Law of God; and as they ſhall by God's Word prove it, Lawful, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful, ſo let
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57946:129"/>
the King proceed, and by that means have the Cauſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his own Country: Whereby he may live in lawful Matrimony with a chearful Mind, and quiet Conſcience; which is much to be deſired by all his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he had thus ſpoke his Mind, they highly Approved of what he ſaid, wiſhing the King had had his Advice before he ſent to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the next Day they coming to the King's Preſence, and he demanding what was done in his Affair, <hi>Fox</hi> recounted to him all that <hi>Cranmer</hi> had ſaid, but <hi>Gardener</hi> would have had the Praiſe of it himſelf; yet the King would not hear him, but turning to <hi>Fox,</hi> he asked him whether <hi>Cranmer</hi> was yet in <hi>Waltham;</hi> and being given to underſtand he was, he immediately ſent for him: Saying, <hi>He Counſels right, had I but known as much two Years ſince, I had not only ſaved infinite Expences, but had lived with a quieter Mind ere this time, then now I do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Introduced, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded if he would ſtand to what he had ſaid. To which he replyed, that he would: Whereupon the King commanded him to write his Opinion, as likewiſe the Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> to furniſh him with private Lodgings, Books, and whatever he required. When <hi>Cranmer</hi> had written as he thought fit, he preſented it to the King, who highly approved it, and asked him if he would make it good before the Pope: The which he undertook to do, and deſired the King, that learned Men might be ſent to other Univerſities to know their Opinions; which was accorded to, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> ſent as the King's Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pope holding forth his pontifical Toe for them to kiſs, an unmannerly Spaniel of the Earls, run and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57946:130"/>
caught it in his Mouth; after which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors refuſed the Favour, and the Pope pulled in his Foot again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cranmer</hi> having made his Buſineſs known, offered to Diſpute with any that would undertake to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt his Opinons: Saying he would prove it <hi>Jure Divino, That a Brother ought not to Marry his Brothers Wife.</hi> But finding none that would Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in that Point; after the Pope had made him his Penitentiary he left <hi>Rome,</hi> and went into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he put the Queſtion to thoſe of the chiefeſt Univerſity, who confirmed what he had ſaid; and he returned into <hi>England,</hi> bringing with him the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of above two hundred learned Men, who concurred with him, that the Marriage was Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time thoſe that the King ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Parts returned, bringing the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of moſt Univerſities, which were coherent with the other. When as the King having kept the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (which became Vacant by the Death of <hi>William Warham</hi>) by the Space of ten Months, upon <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Return he beſtowed it on him, though he much declined it, having delay'd his Buſineſs the longer, in hopes ſome one or other would obtain it before his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; for he well knew that he muſt not only take an Oath to the Pope, but by ſuch an Advancement incur the Envy of many, who gaped for ſuch a Promotion: But the King preſſing it upon him, he could not refuſe it; yet he gave the Popes Bull into the King's Hand ſaying, <hi>That he would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the chief Biſhoprick of</hi> England <hi>from any, but him who was Head of</hi> England: <hi>Nor take an Oath that was derogatory to the King's Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57946:130"/>Being thus Inveſted Primate of <hi>England,</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf ſo Circumſpect, and was ſo Meek, and Merciful, that it grew to a Proverb, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>For ſeveral Years he had the whole weight of Reforming the Religion upon his Shoulders, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that by Reaſon of the continual Reſort, his Houſe ſeemed rather a publick Court, than a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſe. But he continued not long in this Dignity, before the Popiſh Serpents began to ſpit their Venom: Eſpecially <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who uſed his utmoſt Diligence to bring him into Diſgrace with the King: And in order to effect his wicked Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was the chiefeſt Promoter of the ſix bloody Articles, which coſt many a brave Man his Life. Nor was this all, for they often ſuborned Ruffians to ſwear Treaſon and Hereſie againſt him; but God ſo ordered the matter, that what was objected, was but rarely Believed, and the Undertakers ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encouraged, that they rather brought themſelves into Diſgrace, than this good Biſhop. Yet the King once, to try the Virtue and Patience of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> made him believe he would deliver him up to the Will of his Enemies: But when he perceived he was no ways feared to bring his Actions to the Teſt, and by that diſcerned his Innocence: He gave him his Ring, commanding him to Appeal to him, if they offered to uſe him Uncourteouſly.</p>
                  <p>Next Day he was ſent for, to Appear in the Council-Chamber, to make good ſeveral Articles charged againſt him: But being come into the <hi>Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> they made him wait almoſt an Hour amongſt the Footmen; although himſelf at that time was a Privy Councellor: Of which Diſgrace Dr. <hi>Buts</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57946:131"/>
the Kings Phyſician, giving the King to underſtand, he grew extream angry: Saying, <hi>Ha, do my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors ſo diſgracefully uſe the Primate of</hi> England? and thereupon he ſent to command his Admittance.</p>
                  <p>When he was entred, the Council told him that it was laid to his Charge, that all <hi>England</hi> was turned from the Catholick Faith, and infected with Hereſie by his means: For that by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his private Devotion and Order in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, moſt of the Churches had taken Example. Whereupon he deſired to ſee his Accuſers, that he might ſee what Proof they could make of what they laid to his Charge, that ſo he might return his preſent Anſwer to what they ſhould object againſt him, and thereby clear his Innocence: Saying, That it was not meet that the Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and a Privy Councellor, whoſe Faith was never Bubled, nor call'd in Queſtion, ſhould be Impriſoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was heard; and that he believed what was ſaid was only upon bare Suſpicion: But when he perceived them reſolutely bent to ſend him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> he told them that he was very ſorry they would oblige him to Appeal from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (who were his fellow Councellors, and from whom he expected Juſtice) to the King, and thereupon he delivered the King's Ring, citing them preſently to appear before him, and in the mean time to ſuſpend their Decree: Whereupon they were all ſtruck Blanck, and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who was afterwards Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Said, <hi>Did not I tell you that the King would never ſuffer the Arch-Biſhop to be Impriſoned, unleſs he were guilty of High Treaſon againſt his Majeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they came into the Kings preſence, he ſharply reproved them for their ſo uſing the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,

ſaying, He expected better from them, then to let <hi>Cranmer</hi> who was one of their fellow Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, ſtand amongſt ſerving-men; demanding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them would not have taken it for a great Affront, had they been ſo ſerved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſtriking himſelf on the Breſt, he ſwore that he was more beholden to <hi>Cranmer</hi> then to any man Living, and that upon Tryal he had found that no Prelate whatſoever could be more faithful to his King; and therefore commanded that all that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſhould hold <hi>Cranmer</hi> in high Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Upon this they ſtood Mute for a while; when as the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> breaking ſilence, ſaid, May it pleaſe your Majeſty, it was not our purpoſe to hurt the Arch-Biſhop; but that he being kept in Cuſtody during the Inquiſition, his Innocence might be the ſooner cleared, and the Aſperſion laid upon his Reputation wholly obliterated. But the King An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly replyed, I will not have <hi>Cranmer</hi> thus handled, nor any that are dear to me, but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome malicious Spirits amongſt you, which I will (unleſs you be quiet) reſtrain by interpoſing my Authority. And when he had ſaid thus much, he departed in a great Rage; upon which each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor taking <hi>Cranmer</hi> by the hand, deſired to be Friends with him, to which he eaſily Condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, freely forgiving them, and all others that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways injured him.</p>
                  <p>After this, by reaſon that Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and others, that were ſent to <hi>Canterbury</hi> to inquire into the matter, neglected the ſame, and had done little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein, as being bribed by <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Enemies. The King ſecretly ſent Dr. <hi>Lee,</hi> impowering him to ſearch the houſes of ſome eminent Papiſts, the which he did at Mid-night, and there ſurprized ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57946:132"/>
Letters ſent by <hi>Gardener,</hi> another to give Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Management of the deſign, and amongſt the reſt, two, one from the <hi>Suffragan</hi> of <hi>Dover,</hi> and another Dr. <hi>Barber</hi> a <hi>Civilian</hi> man, whom he had not only advanced, but greatly confided in.</p>
                  <p>When theſe Letters were brought to the King, he ſent for <hi>Cranmer</hi> and delivered them to him, bidding him now ſince he knew his Enemies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them. When he was gone from the Kings preſence, he ſent for the <hi>Suffragan</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barber,</hi> telling them that he had been ſhamefully abuſed, by ſome whom he moſt truſted; and that they had not only revealed his inmoſt Counſels, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe raiſed many falſe Scandals of him. Therefore he had called them to give him their advice, what was beſt to be done upon that occaſion. Marry quoth Dr. <hi>Barber,</hi> ſuch Villains deſerve hanging, nay, hanging is too good for them. Yea, ſaid the <hi>Suffragan,</hi> rather then they ſhould want an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, I my ſelf would be he. Upon this the Arch-Biſhop lifting up his Eyes towards Heaven, ſaid, <hi>O Lord and moſt merciful God, who may a man truſt in theſe days, &amp;c.</hi> and thereupon he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether they knew thoſe Letters. When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that their Villanies were brought to Light, they fell upon their Knees, and begged his Pardon for their offences. Which he eaſily forgave, ſaying, God make you good men; I never deſerved this at your hands, but ask God forgiveneſs, whom you have ſo highly offended.</p>
                  <p>And in ſuch Conflicts continued he, againſt his Popiſh Adverſaries, till the Death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth Reigning he had more quiet, and greatly helped on the Reformation, by incouraging Godly men therein, not only with his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57946:132"/>
Doctrine and Authority, but with his Eſtate. But the good King dying, his bloody Siſter no ſooner came to the Crown, but he was impriſoned in the <hi>Tower,</hi> refuſing to fly altho he might have done it, ſaying, that had he been accuſed of Theft, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or any other notorious Crimes, he could ſafely have done it: But being to Anſwer for his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Allegiance he owed to Heaven, and concerning the Truth of the holy Scriptures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the great oppoſers thereof; he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe his Life in defence of the Truth, then by flying out of the Kingdom, deſert ſuch a Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>He having continued a conſiderable time in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there often Examined and perſwaded to recant, but utterly refuſing to hearken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he was ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Examinations and great Promiſes if he would recant, he was brought before the Queens Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſioners and Popes Delegates; but the Authority of the latter he would by no means own, yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to degrade and ſentence him, altho he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from the Pope, to the next general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</p>
                  <p>After this they carried him back to Priſon, at which he ſeemed not at all dejected, but with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Countenance demanded meat, having eaten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the day before, ſaying, I was much troubled but now I thank God my heart is at quiet. After this the popiſh Doctors frequently viſited him, and uſed all the Arguments they could, to perſwade him to a Recantation; but he abſolutely reſolved for a Conſiderable time, but at laſt through Humane frailty and deſire of Life, he did ſubſcribe to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, but ſo far were his Enemies from fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Promiſe, that they haſtened his Death;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57946:133"/>
yet let him not know of it, till the Morning he was to be Executed; when as they brought him out, and ſet him upon a Stage for the People to gaze at, whilſt Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> declared upon what Account he was brought thither, laying open for what he was Condemned: But above all told, them how he had recanted; yet his Life could not be Pardoned, for the Deaths of Sr. <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> could no other ways be attoned for. But the true Cauſe of it was, that Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> gaped for the Arch-Biſhoprick, which he could not have during the Life of <hi>Cranmer.</hi> Then they deſired him publickly to Confeſs, what he had privately done. When as the good Biſhop being greatly Afflicted, and troubled in his Conſcience, for what he had done; burſt out into a Flood of Tears, and after his Speech came to him; he lifted up his hands towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying; O Lord forgive me this great Sin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy holy Name; which through the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fleſh. I have unadviſedly Committed. And then addreſſing himſelf to the People, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſake, to pray for him; that God would pardon his Sins, and Eſpecially that of his Recantation, which lay moſt heavy on his Conſcience; for that he had done it contrary to the Truth that he conceived in his Heart; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light of his own underſtanding, Satan hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing induced him thereto, by laying before him, the Terribleneſs of Death; but, ſay'd he, this right hand that ſigned ſo wicked an Inſtrument, ſhall firſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the Flames. He would have proceeded, but the Popiſh Doctors who little expected he would ſpeak in ſuch a Dialect, fell to Bawling ſo loud, and curſing him that he could not be heard further; then they pulled him down, and hurried him away
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57946:133"/>
to the Fire, which was made in the ſame place where <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> had ſuffered, ſtopping his mouth leſt he ſhould any more ſpeak to the People; who were not a little grieved; to ſee the Primate of <hi>England</hi> caſt down from all his Honours, and in the end ſo barbarouſly miſ-uſed.</p>
                  <p>When he came to the Stake, he fell down on his Knees and Prayed; but was interrupted by the Papiſts, who followed him with his Recantation, ſaying, have you not ſigned it, have you not ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it? Then he was tyed to the Stake, his cloaths being firſt put off, and the Fire being kindled to him, ſome time before it came at his Body; he ſtretched forth his right Hand, and held it in the Flames till it fell off, without any more then once drawing it back. And after having recommended his Spirit, into the hand of our merciful Redeemer the Lord Jeſus: he dyed like a Lamb, ending his Life with the ſame Meekneſs as he had lived, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Martyrdom for the ſake of the everlaſting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1556. and of his Age 72.</p>
                  <p>One thing more is worthy to be noted, and of all Admiration, which, that his Body being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to Aſhes, his Heart was found unſinged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, or in the leaſt ſullied in the Flame: The like had it happened to any Catholick tho dying for Treaſon, it had been blown over all <hi>Europe</hi> as a Miracle, and that Miracle had been enough to Saint him.</p>

                     <hi>JOhn Philpot</hi> was born in <hi>Hampſhire</hi> of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parents, and after his being fitted for the Univerſity, he was ſent to <hi>New Colledg</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there profited ſo much in his Studies, he was ſoon perfect in all the Tongues; and then betook himſelf to the Study of the Civil Law, and after that Divinity; being a Man of a moſt pregnant Wit. Yet ſhewing his Opinion too openly in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, during the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, he was often in Danger by reaſon of the Malice of his Adverſaries. Inſomuch that to avoid them, he Travelled to <hi>Italy,</hi> where he was not ſafe neither, for by reaſon of the great Zeal he had for God's Holy Word, he could not forbear to ſpeak againſt the Idolatries and Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Yet through the Protection of the Almighty, who reſerv'd him as a choſen Veſſel, to propagate the Reformation in his own Country, He at the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57946:134"/>
Reign arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and was ſhortly after his coming made Arch-Deacon of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> But when the Bloody Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to mount the Throne he loſt his Place, yet continued his Title, when within a while after, a Convocation by the Queen's Command was called in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, where Dr. <hi>Weſton</hi> being Prolocutor, Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> was likewiſe choſen by the Biſhops and others of the reformed Church, to oppoſe the Papiſts in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: Where he ſo learnedly managed his Part, that he put his Adverſaries to Silence; and when they perceived that no Arguments would bear them out, they threatened him with a Priſon if he ſpoke any more; and ſo within a ſhort time after, procured a Mandate from the Queen to break up the Convocation. The Prolocutor who had all along uſed ſuch inſolent Behaviour, as ſhould be far from one in his place: Saying, That they were all well enough. <hi>For,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>we have the Sword, and you have the Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within a while after there came an Order from <hi>Gardener</hi> to apprehend Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and he committed to Priſon: And then being ſent for by Dr. <hi>Story,</hi> he firſt Examined him, and afterwards ſent him to <hi>Bonner,</hi> who put him in his <hi>Cole-Houſe,</hi> where he found one <hi>Smith</hi> a Miniſter of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who having been formerly there, at the Importunities of <hi>Bonner</hi> had made his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, and was diſmiſſed: But finding ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Torments in his Conſcience, that he could reſt neither Day nor Night; he came to the Biſhop's Regiſter, and deſired to ſee his Recantation, upon pretence of adding ſomething more; but the Book was no ſooner opened, but he tore it in pieces, and then immediately found eaſe: Yet was he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57946:135"/>
and carried before <hi>Bonner,</hi> who not only railed at him, but beat him with his Fiſt, tore off his Hair, and uſed many other Outrages, which he patiently indured, rejoycing at his outward Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and induring his Impriſonment better than his Inlargement.</p>
                  <p>Within a Day or two Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> was ſent for to appear before <hi>Bonner,</hi> who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ed how he could be ſo Merry as to ſing Pſalms in ſuch a Place, Rejoycing in his Naughtineſs. Not ſo my Lord, ſaid Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> but according to the Directions of St. <hi>Paul</hi> we rejoyce in the Lord, ſinging together in Hymns and Spiritual Songs; for we are in a dark and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs Place, and therefore we comfort our ſelves as well as we can, leſt as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay's, <hi>Sorrow ſhould eat up the Heart.</hi> Therefore ſeeing the Apoſtle ſay's, <hi>If a Man be of an upright Mind, let him ſing Pſalms;</hi> and we being ſo, I hope your Lordſhip will not be Angry. Then <hi>Bonner</hi> demanded his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about the Sacrament, but he replyed in the Words of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Valentinian, Tolle Legem &amp; fiat certamen, Take away the Law and I will diſpute.</hi> For ſhould I now do it, I ſhould bring my ſelf into a Snare; neither do I think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to anſwer in Private, but if I am called to anſwer in Publick, as the Law ſhall require; I ſhall not be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, nor the Teſtimony I have born of it.</p>
                  <p>Then was he again carried to the <hi>Cole-Houſe,</hi> where he profeſſed he ſlept as well upon Straw, as on a Bed of Down. Such is it to have a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which as the wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>Is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He being ſent for again, found ſeveral Doctors and Biſhops with <hi>Bonner,</hi> who were come to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

                  <p>After this, the Biſhops demanded if he would Recant, but he told them he would not, unleſs they could convince him of any Error by Scripture; but they would not Diſpute, and the Conference ended, and he was Remanded to the <hi>Cole-hole,</hi> and there ſet in the Stocks; and within a ſhort time after Condemned, Degraded, and ſent to <hi>Newgate:</hi> When by the Way he Exhorted the People to be Conſtant, and Perſevere in the Faith of Chriſt; and deſired them to bleſs God for that Day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>When he came to <hi>Newgate,</hi> he was put into a diſconſolate Place by himſelf, and had Word brought him the next Morning, that he muſt Suffer that Day; when with a chearful Countenance he replyed, I am ready, God grant me Strength, and a joyful Reſurrection. And after his having reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a while to Pray, he came forth, and was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed

into <hi>Smithfield,</hi> where he no ſooner came but he fell on his Knees, and with a loud Voice cryed, I will pay my Vows in thee O <hi>Smithfield.</hi> Then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up he Kiſſed and Imbraced the Stake; ſaying, Shall I diſdain to ſuffer at this Stake, when my Lord and Saviour refuſed not to Suffer a moſt vile Death for me? And ſo after having pow'red out his Soul to God, he ſuffered himſelf to be bound with the Chain; and when the Fire was kindled, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Spirit into the Hands of the Father of all Spirits, and patiently gave up the Ghoſt.

                  <p>About this time, by reaſon of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Sickneſs, all the Care of the Church lay upon him; the which he ſo well managed, that the true Light of ſaving Knowledge, began to ſpread it's Rays into moſt of the Corners of <hi>Germany:</hi> He being about to go to <hi>Hagenaw,</hi> he made his Will and left it with Mr. <hi>Cruciger,</hi> at which time he fore-ſeeing his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which in a ſhort time after befell him, he wrote this Verſe.</p>

of a mild Nature, replyed, <hi>Sir, I ſeek not mine own Glory in this Buſineſs, but the Truth; to morrow, God willing, you ſhall hear farther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Wars brake out in <hi>Germany,</hi> he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fore-ſaw in a Dream, the Captivity of the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſs,</hi> and Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> long time before they were taken Priſoners, by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts: And the next day after he had ſo dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a Meſſenger came to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> to deliver him up; but the Prince refuſed it, upon which the Emperor grew exceeding Angry; and for that, and ſome other denials he had received, he reſolved to invade <hi>Saxony.</hi> Which he did accordingly with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Army, this made <hi>Melancthone</hi> much bewail the Calamity, occaſioned by the furious Papiſts, who had ſworn to Root out all the Proteſtants. But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven prevented them, altho they did much Miſchief, and made great ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p>After his Return to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> the Plague broke out, upon which the Univerſity removed to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaw,</hi> whither he came, and there received News of the Death of his Wife, at which he only ſaid; <hi>Farewel Kate, I ſhall follow thee ere long.</hi> This by moſt was looked upon to proceed, from his wonderful Patience, for he loved her above all Earthly things.</p>
                  <p>After his coming thither, he had many Diſputes with the Popiſh party, both by Words and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>
                     <hi>PEter Martyr,</hi> was by Birth a <hi>Florentine:</hi> Born at <hi>Vermile, Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1500. of Honourable Parents. Who during his Minority trained him up in Learning, and gave him ſuch pious Inſtructions, as by his Improvement, compleated him for the Sacred ſtudy of the Holy Scripture: When he was grown up they put him to School, to the beſt Maſters that Age afforded; under whom, when he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited to Admiration, he began to conſider the many Vanities of the World, and to be more ſtudious of his Eternal Welfare. Whereupon he reſolved to withdraw himſelf, from Humane Society; and to Live a more retired Life. Whereupon not being above ſixteen years of Age, he entered into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of regular Cannons of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57946:139"/>
                     <hi>Feſſuala,</hi> a little Town not far diſtant from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Florence:</hi> Altho much againſt the will of his Parents.</p>
                  <p>Being thus entered, he applyed himſelf duly to Study, making uſe of ſuch Books as the Library of that Monaſtry would afford; where in three Years he became famous in the Knowledg of Divine Things, even to the Admiration of all his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>A while after he went to <hi>Padua,</hi> where entring into a Monaſtry of the ſame Order, he continued his Studies for almoſt the ſpace of eight Years, greatly Profiting in the Rules of Philoſophy, to the Study of which he much addicted himſelf, Tranſlating ſome Books of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> out of the Original Greek into Latin.</p>
                  <p>When he was twenty ſix Years of Age, the Heads of the Monaſtery Elected him one of the Preachers, in which Station he continued a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, and was ſo great a Proficient therein, that he ſoon grew Famous: So that having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Dr. of Divinity, he Travelled to <hi>Rome, Bononia, Frimum, Piſa, Venice, Mantua, Bergamum, Mount-Ferrat,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Italy;</hi> where he Preached and Expounded the Eccleſiaſtical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ons, getting himſelf by ſuch means great Eſteem amongſt the Learned.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Bononia</hi> he learned the Hebrew Tongue, and Tranſlated the New Teſtament out of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: So that in a ſhort time he was Created Abbot of <hi>Spoleta,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he won the Love of all the People in that City. He likewiſe put an end to the many Factions and Differences, that were wont to happen not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, but throughout all the Province, which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57946:140"/>
was not a little Joy to all good Men: By reaſon great Miſchiefs had happ'ned by Inteſtine Cryes that thoſe Feuds had occaſioned; and altho many of his Predeceſſors had undertaken to Reconcile the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Spirits, or Heads of the Factious, their Labours proved Inefectual.</p>
                  <p>He alſo Rectified, and much Reformed the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Monks, and ſharply reproved them for their deteſtable Practices, inſomuch that he reduced all things to a happy State, during the time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there, which was but three Years; at the end of which he was removed to <hi>Naples,</hi> and there Conſtituted Governour of the great Colledg, which is a place of much Eſteem.</p>
                  <p>Here he having more Leiſure than formerly, began ſeriouſly to Expound, and Unridle the dark and myſterious Places of Scripture: Which by the more than ordinary Aſſiſtance of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he did ſo effectually, that by that Light he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcern the Errors of the Romiſh Church; and having private Acceſs to ſome of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters, he was ſo confirmed in his Opinion, that he had been trained up in a falſe Religion; that he did not ſpare openly to Diſpute againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Popiſh Canons: Which procured him ſome Hatred from ſuch as feared the loſs of their Incom's by the Removal of ſuch Ceremonies: And ſo far did he proceed, that at laſt he obtained the pure Light and Knowledg of the Goſpel, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly Converted many noble Perſons to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, and openly wrote againſt the Tradition of Purgatory, which the firſt Inventor grounded upon the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>Every Mans Works ſhall be made Manifeſt, for the Day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be Revealed by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57946:140"/>
Fire,</hi> &amp;c. This Fire he proves to be no other than the Operation of the Holy Spirit in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Men, which as Fire trieth the Silver, ſo by that means ſhall Mens Deeds be tryed, and the Droſs ſeparated from the Ore. Yet this ſo inrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Papiſts, that they procured him to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, and his Lectures put down.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he Appealed to the Pope, offering to prove his Doctrine to be according to Scripture; and ſo prevailed by the Aſſiſtance of his Friends, that he was again reſtored altho to the great Grief of his Adverſaries: But had not long been Re-eſtabliſhed before he fell Sick, ſo that many deſpaired of his Recovery: Yet God who had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him as <hi>a choſen Veſſel to make his Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce;</hi> delivered him from the Jaws of Death, to the great Comfort of his Friends, and Grief of his Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>He was no ſooner recovered, but he was made Viſitor-General, and within a ſhort time after, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the Monaſtery of <hi>Luca,</hi> where he ſo well behaved himſelf, that he gained the good Will of all honeſt Men there. He greatly encouraged Learning, and had a great number of learned Men as his Penſioners, on whom he freely beſtowed ſuch things as were convenient, and encouraging them all he could to promote the Knowledg of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Whil'ſt he ſtayed at <hi>Luca, Charles</hi> the Fifth, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and Cardinal <hi>Contarene</hi> the Pope's Legate came thither, the latter being entertained by <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> When as the Pope underſtanding his Inclination to the reformed Religion, he uſed all Endeavours to find ſome occaſion of Quarrel againſt him, the which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57946:141"/>
he thought not fit to do, unleſs upon good Grounds, becauſe he knew he was greatly beloved of all the People, both Noble, and Ignoble; and therefore to try how they ſtood affected, ere he waded too far in their Diſpleaſure, he cauſed a Fryer belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Monaſtery of which <hi>Peter</hi> was Prior, to be arreſted and caſt in Priſon, as being a Favourer of the reformed Doctors; which the People took ſo hainouſly (as well knowing he was an honeſter Man, and better Chriſtian than the Pope) that they broke open the Priſon and took him thence, but he being afterwards apprehended, was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there put to Death: And after that the Poplings uſed all Diligence to bring <hi>Martyr</hi> into Diſgrace, and many times laid wait to murther him, inſomuch that fearing he ſhould one Day fall by the Malice of his Enemies, he reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſecretly; whereupon he called together ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his truſty Friends, and told them what he intended, deſiring them to ſend the beſt part of his Library after him into <hi>Germany;</hi> which they promiſed, and accordingly performed.</p>
                  <p>After he had made his Eſcape, he went to Viſit the Univerſities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and at laſt came to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> which ſome time before had embraced the reformed Religion; and there he became a Greek Profeſſor, Inſtructing and Training up many Youths: He alſo wrote to the Senators of <hi>Luca,</hi> to perſwade them to embrace the true Doctrine of the Goſpel, and not be any longer led in Ignorance, with vain and ſuperſtitious Errors: Shewing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Cheats and wicked Practices of ſuch as pretended to ſtrictneſs of Life in Monaſteries, and ſuch like Places.</p>
                  <p>And now having utterly renounced Popery, he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57946:141"/>
joyned himſelf to the Doctors of the reformed Church, and wrote ſharply againſt the Papiſts, which inraged them the more. Whilſt he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> which was for five Years, he held a Divinity-Lecture, and expounded the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; being always very Charitable to ſuch as ſtood in need of his Aſſiſtance. Here alſo, by the Perſwaſion of his Friends, he Married one <hi>Katherine Damp Mortin,</hi> a Virgin, deſcended of a noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; who accompanying him into <hi>England,</hi> dyed after ſhe had been eight Years married. In the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> her Body being dug up, was buried in a Dunghil by the Command of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who alledged that ſhe was Buryed too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, at the earneſt Requeſt of the King, he came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being nobly entertained by Arch-Biſhop <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>anmer,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Summerſet</hi> then Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and many others: So that after having aſſiſted in Setling Religion, he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there became a Profeſſor of Divinity, and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scriptures to the People, ſo that his Fame ſoon ſpread into the utmoſt Corners of the Land, which made the Papiſts greatly Diſpleaſed, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſeveral of the popiſh Doctors often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to Diſputations; in which he always overcame them, as having the Truth on his Side.</p>
                  <p>But that ſufficed not; for when they found that they could not overcome him by Arguments, they endeavoured it by Force, often raiſing Tumults,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57946:142"/>
and thereby endangering his Life; yet wanted he not ſuch Friends as encouraged him to proceed in the great Work of Reformation, being ever back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> and <hi>Hooper,</hi> and ſo continued in <hi>England</hi> all the Reign of pious King <hi>Edward.</hi> But when the Blood-thirſty Queen once got the Reins of Government, and true Religion was ſuppreſſed, his Lectures ceaſed, and he Lived more retire with his Friends, encouraging and ſtrengthening them to perſevere in the Faith, and true Religion they had received: And amongſt the reſt Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who began ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to waver in his Opinion, ever after confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>Martyr</hi> had Confirmed him.</p>
                  <p>When ſeveral Godly Men were Impriſoned, and the Perſecution grew hot; it was debated in the Queen's Council, whether <hi>Martyr</hi> ſhould be Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned or not, by reaſon he had done much harm by his Innovations, as they pretended; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that he came over upon the publick Faith, it was concluded that he ſhould be ſafely diſmiſſed, and thereupon the Queen gave him her Letters of ſafe Conduct, ſtrictly commanding him to depart the Kingdom: To which he was obedient. Yet ſuch was the Malice of his Enemies, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to the Ship, and held a Conſult whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould pull him out, and caſt him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or not. But God prevented their wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by ſending a Wind, that immediately bore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Veſſel to <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and he landing there, ſafely Travelled through many Cities and Towns, till at laſt he came to <hi>Stratbourg,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with much Joy of his Friends, though there he wanted not ſome Enemies who gave him many Diſturbances all the time of his Stay there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57946:142"/>From thence he removed to <hi>Zurick,</hi> where he held firm Friendſhip with Mr. <hi>Bullenger,</hi> which he continued till the day of his Death.</p>
                  <p>In this City, he ſo far gained the Love of all men, that he was made free of the ſame; and now it being a Conſiderable time, ſince he buried his firſt Wife, he bethought himſelf of taking another: Whereupon by the advice of his Friends, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried one <hi>Catherine Marenda,</hi> a Vertuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman: Who for Religions ſake had fled the French Perſecution, and was come to Live at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time, he was called to the Paſtor-ſhip of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church at <hi>Geneva,</hi> but ſuch was his Love to thoſe of <hi>Zurick,</hi> that notwithſtanding the many Entreaties that were uſed to perſwade him to embrace ſo great a Benefit, he would not accept thereof; but choſe rather to continue with his tryed Friends, then to adventure amongſt Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, altho, he was never backward in any thing that might promote the true worſhip of God, as appears by his Voluntary going into <hi>France.</hi> At the Diſputation held between the Miniſters of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion and the Leaguers; appointed to be held at <hi>Poitou,</hi> before the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navar,</hi> the two Queens, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and Admiral of <hi>Cologne;</hi> Where he and his Fellows, ſo managed the matter, that they obliged their Adverſaries to Confeſs, that they were in the Right; and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſigning many Articles repugnant to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of which the popiſh Biſhops grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly Complained, ſaying; <hi>That their Diſputants, had betrayed their Truſts; and that they would by no means accord to what they had done.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> deſired leave to depart, which he obtained, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57946:143"/>
ſo returned to <hi>Zurick.</hi> Where he was received with great Joy, yet being worn out with Travel, and daily Study he after a while fell ſick, when call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the Principal Paſtors of the Church, he made to them, an excellent Confeſſion of his Faith, Concluding, <hi>This is my Faith, and they that teach otherwiſe, to the withdrawing men from God, God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</hi> And ſo taking his Leave of all his Friends, after having made his Will he gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1562. and of his Age ſixty two, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him a laſting Fame, which Age can never conſume.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>JOhn Calvin,</hi> was Born at <hi>Noviodune,</hi> a City of <hi>France, Anno</hi> 1509. His Fathers name being <hi>Gerard,</hi> and his Mothers <hi>Joanna;</hi> both of Godly life, and Living in great Eſteem, amongſt the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:57946:143"/>So ſoon as our <hi>John</hi> was grown to be capable of Learning, he was ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> and there inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſuch <hi>Literature</hi> as the Schools of that City could afford: Inſomuch that he greatly profited, being deſirous of knowledge in Sacred things, he applyed himſelf to the Study of the Scriptures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho his Father was more inclinable, to have him a Student of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>In a ſhort time after, taking degree of Maſter of Arts, he was preferred to a Benifice: Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Rector of <hi>Biſhops-bridge,</hi> near the City of <hi>Noviodune.</hi> Where he taught according to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſeveral years ſtill increaſing in Learning; till at laſt falling into the acquaintance of a reformed Miniſter, called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Robert Olivitian,</hi> he began by the continual Converſation he had with this good man, to ſee into the Errors of the Romiſh Church, by the pure light of the Goſpel: Inſomuch that plainly perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt part of the Romiſh Traditions, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Ceremonies, repugnant to the Word of God, he began to bethink with himſelf, that ſeeing he had ſo long lived in Error, it was now high time to embrace the Truth; and thereupon more ſeriouſly conſulting his Friend, he reſolved to renounce the Popiſh Religion, and joyn with the Miniſters of the reformed Church: Whereupon he ſecretly departed to <hi>Orleance,</hi> and there joyning himſelf to <hi>Peter Stella,</hi> who read a Lecture in that City, he in a ſhort time grew famous, having many that reſorted to him for Sacred Conſolation.</p>
                  <p>In this place, he wholly applyed himſelf to the Study of the Scriptures, and therein profited Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; and after having continued here for the ſpace of ſix Months, he departed for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57946:144"/>
of <hi>Biturg,</hi> where he became a Greek Profeſſor, and Preached ſeveral Sermons, at an adjacent Town called <hi>Liveria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had ſtayed a while at <hi>Bitury,</hi> and gotten great Applauſe, for his ſingular Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he went to <hi>Paris;</hi> where he aſſociated himſelf, with the Profeſſors of the reformed Religion. But he had not been here long, before the Papiſts began to find an Alteration in his Life, and Converſation, and thereby fearing (what indeed had happened) that he was fallen from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they more narrowly obſerved him, ſeeking all occaſions of Quarrel againſt him; yet he was not at all daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, altho ſome endeavoured to take his Life. But like a Palm Tree, the more they ſtrove to depreſs him, the more he grew in Reputation with all Good men. And having attained the Perfection of humane Learning, he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there ſtudied Divinity; Accompanying himſelf, for the moſt part with <hi>Stephen Forgeus</hi> a Godly Chriſtian; who was afterwards put to Death for his Religion, by the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>About this time, <hi>Nicholas Cope,</hi> being Lector of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> When on All-Saints day he made his Oration, he greatly inſiſted on the Purity of Religion, when as the uſe was upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to tell ſtories of the Miracles, done by ſuch and ſuch Saints; and to Extoll them, to the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Crowd. But this he did at the Inſtance of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> having notice of, were much diſpleaſed, and cited him to appear before them; But being adviſed by his Well-wiſhers to the contrary, and finding by daily Experience, that he laid Snares for him, he ſecretly left <hi>France,</hi> and went to <hi>Baſil.</hi> Where he had likewiſe fallen into
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57946:144"/>
Danger, had not the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> delivered him, and Diſ-countenanced his Adverſary; but he finding that place unſafe, departed to <hi>Xanton:</hi> where at the requeſt of ſeveral Godly Chriſtians, his Friends, he wrote ſeveral Heads of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, moſt neceſſary to Salvation, and cauſed them to be diſperſed amongſt the People; which gave many ſo clear a Light, that with leſs Difficulty, they were able to perceive the Errors, they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Lived in, and to find the way that Leads to Life. Yet here he reſted not long, before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Papiſts purſued him. But the good Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> who ever was his Friend, ſent him with a Conduct to a Town, that was under her Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Where he continued with great Applauſe for many days, and afterwards went to <hi>Paris;</hi> where he continued till the Perſecution aroſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Papiſts, wherein ſeveral were in Priſon, and ſtarved to Death, many put to grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Torments, and eight burnt alive, at a ſolemn Proceſſion: Wherein King <hi>Francis</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren aſſiſted, the King ſwearing that he would not ſpare his deareſt Child, if he found him infected with damned Hereſie, as he then called the true and ſincere preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This Perſecution, made Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> have regard to the words of our bleſſed Saviour, when he ſaid, if they Perſecute you in one City, ſlee to another. And therefore leaving <hi>Paris,</hi> he went to <hi>Orleance;</hi> where he publiſhed a Book, to confute the Errors of thoſe who had long ſince received a falſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Soul ſlept after it was ſeperated from the Body. And then he journied to <hi>Xanton,</hi> and within a while to <hi>Baſil;</hi> when in the way his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who carried his Money, being well mount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57946:145"/>
Rid away from him, and left him in great neceſſity, till God raiſed him up Friends to relieve him.</p>
                  <p>Being come to <hi>Baſil,</hi> he aſſociated himſelf with the reformed Miniſters he found there, as the famous <hi>Grynaeus, Wolfgang,</hi> and <hi>Capito,</hi> men of excellent Piety and Learning; here alſo he ſtudied the Hebrew Tongue, and as much as in him lay concealed himſelf; but upon the coming forth of his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Papiſts that remained there, began to gueſs who was the Author.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> had heard of the Cruelty of King <hi>Francis,</hi> and ſent their Deputies to reprove him, for uſing ſuch Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty towards the People of God. But he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſaying, that they were only a few Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that ſought to make Innovations in his Kingdom. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote a Book, and dedicated it to the King; wherein he declared, who were true Chriſtians, and who were not; But whether the King ever read it, or not, it is uncertain. When being deſirous to viſit the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Lewis,</hi> the twelfth King of <hi>France;</hi> a Woman ſingular for the Love of Piety, and a great Encourager of Learned men: He went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and was received by her with inexpreſſible Joy. And having continued in her Court for ſome time, prevailed with her, to ſuffer him to depart, which ſhe conſenting to, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for <hi>Geneva:</hi> Where he no ſooner arrived, but he was compelled to ſtay there by the Miniſters of the Church; and had offered him, either to Preach publickly to the People, or to be Divinity-Profeſſor: The latter of which he embraced. Whereupon he applyed his utmoſt diligence, to reform ſuch things as were amiſs, not by his own Opinions, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57946:145"/>
of the Scriptures, to the general content of all good men, and ſuch remainders of popiſh Superſtition, as were left unpurged, he by his great Pains and Induſtry removed. He likewiſe oppoſed himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Ana-baptiſts,</hi> that ſought to hinder the Reformation, and to ſtir up the People to Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo well ſetled the Affairs of the Church by his Prudence, and Conduct, that he overthrew the Devices of certain <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who began to Poyſon the People with their Erroneous Opinions; and by the Prayers of the Church againſt them; So that their Ring-leader was ſmitten by the hand of God, and dyed of many grievous Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>About this time, there being many of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church in <hi>France,</hi> who yet for fear went to hear popiſh Maſs, conceiving an Opinion, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they were perſonally at that Worſhip, and yet retained their proper Religion in their Hearts, it was no ſin. But to theſe, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote two Epiſtles, telling them that by ſuch means Satan had a great advantage over them, and that if they were aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to own and profeſs Chriſt openly before men, he would not own them before his Father, and the holy Angels, and by this means he ſo Animated many of them, that they profeſſing their Religion openly, and oppoſing the Popiſh Idolatries, were Condemned, and ſealed their Teſtimonies with their Blood.</p>
                  <p>After this, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> bent all his Endeavours to eſtabliſh a ſet Form of Religion, in the <hi>Genevan</hi> Church, and for that end he drew up certain Heads of Religion: And ſo far prevailed with the Senate and People as to ſwear to them, altho ſome rigid Papiſts greatly oppoſed his Proceeding.</p>
                  <p>This was no ſooner done, but the <hi>Ana-baptiſts</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57946:146"/>
began to ſtir up the Faction, as likewiſe one <hi>Peter Caroli</hi> a Heretick, who by his Blasphemies and wicked Doctrine, drew many into foul Errors, which cauſed the Synod at <hi>Berne</hi> to Condemn him as a Deceiver of the People: Which cauſed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to <hi>Mediomatrice,</hi> and there uſed his utmoſt Endeavours to root out the Profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: But failing of his Purpoſe, he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where being rejected, and becoming deſtitute of Friends; through Poverty and many noiſom Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes he ended his wretched Life.</p>
                  <p>About this time, notwithſtanding the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and many other good Men, a Sedition ſprung up in the City of <hi>Geneva;</hi> for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Chief, envying each others Greatneſs, as being privately accended by the Popiſh Prieſts in religious Guiſe, ſeveral Tumults happened in which many were hurt: The which Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> well perceived would tend to great Miſchief, if it were not in time alay'd; wherefore he and the reſt of the Godly Miniſters, oppoſed themſelves againſt the moſt Reſolute, declaring that unleſs they ceaſed their Feudes, and laid aſide all Enmity between themſelves, he did not think it meet to Adminiſter the Holy Sacrament to them; which made many of them contemn him as a Man that ſought the whole Power of the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</p>
                  <p>About this time a Difference happened between thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Bern</hi> about Adminiſtring the Sacrament; the former doing it with plain Bread, and the latter with Wafers, the former aboliſhed all Holydays, unleſs the Sabbath, when as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther held it neceſſary to obſerve the ſeveral Tides; and thereupon Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and the reſt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were Accuſed by the Factious as the Cauſers
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57946:146"/>
of ſuch Diviſion; which they Underſtanding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be heard, but could not obtain their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: And it being urged that they had proudly refuſed to Adminiſter the Sacrament to ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, a Decree paſſed for their Baniſhment, the which, when it came to the Hands of Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin;</hi> he ſaid, Well if I had ſerved Man I ſhould have had but an ill Reward, but it is good that I have ſerved him, who doth always perform to his Servants that which he hath once Promiſed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> being thus baniſhed, goes to <hi>Zurick:</hi> But before his Departure, ſuch was his Fatherly Care, that he provided fit Paſtors to feed the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevan Flock, leſt in his Abſence the Romiſh Wolves ſhould break in and Deſtroy what he by his Labour and Induſtry had Planted.</p>
                  <p>During his Abſence, the reſt of the Helvetian Churches, laboured with the Genevans for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion, but they at preſent refuſing it; he went to <hi>Bazil,</hi> from thence to <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> where he met with <hi>Bucer, Hedio,</hi> and <hi>Capito,</hi> all famous Preachers of the Goſpel, who greatly rejoyced in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and by their means he was choſen Divinity Profeſſor, and all the while took care of his Flock at <hi>Geneva,</hi> by often writing to them to ſtrengthen them, and vindicate their Cauſe againſt ſuch Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Doctors as in his Abſence ſought to traduce them. He being now ſomewhat at Leiſure, wrote many Divine Tracts, which he ſent to the Churches, the better to Inable them to reſiſt their Spiritual Enemies: And when as <hi>Strode</hi> dyed, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> by the Conſent of his Friends Married his Widow, a moſt Vertuous and Chaſt Woman; after which he went as an Aſſiſtant to the Diets of <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Ratisbone</hi> Aſſembled by the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57946:147"/>
the fifth for compoſing Differences in Religion; and ſo continued, till thoſe that had procured the Decree of his Baniſhment from the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> were dead; and then the Citizens ſent to <hi>Strasbourg</hi> to deſire him and Mr. <hi>Farell</hi> to return, expreſſing the earneſt Deſire they had to ſee them; but the Citizens of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> were by no means willing to loſe their Company, and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf ſhewed the like Unwillingneſs to leave them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had received ſuch great Kindneſſes at their Hands: But in the end, the <hi>Genevans</hi> ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that upon the Senate's ſigning a Decree for their Return again to <hi>Strasbourg, Bucer</hi> prevailed with the Citizens to let <hi>Calvin</hi> go thither; where he was received with all imaginable Expreſſions of Joy: And ſuch was their deſire of Detaining him, that they never left urging the Senate till they had got the Decree of his Returning to <hi>Strasbourg</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed: And now being again ſetled in paſtoral Charge of <hi>Geneva,</hi> he continued to Confute Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Papiſts, and Stirrers up of Sedition; to heal Breaches and Diviſion, being Couragious even in the worſt of times, and as an undaunted Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt not to follow his Standard till Death, who Conquers all, Conquered him; for having made his will, he received the Sacrament, and earneſtly Prayed for the Churches. He on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>May, Anno Chriſti</hi> 1562, yielded up his Spirit into the Hands of his Maker, dying in the 55 Year of his Age: The loſs of ſuch a Piller of the Church cauſing no ſmall Grief.</p>
                  <p>His Funeral Solemnities were performed at the Charge of the Senate, almoſt all the City being preſent; he being Buried, as himſelf deſired, in the Church Yard, where a ſtately Tomb was Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Memory.</p>

                     <hi>JOhn Jewel</hi> was Born in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> at the Town of <hi>Buden Anno Domini</hi> 1522, of Eminent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who deſirous of his Promotion as to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs, brought him up in Learning to the higheſt Degree, and eſpecially in the Knowledg of the Scriptures, which are able to make us Wiſe unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p>When he was thirteen Years of Age, he was ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there entered into <hi>Merton</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, where under the Tuition of Dr. <hi>Parkhurſt</hi> he ſo well Profited, that all admired his ready Wit and Promptitude.

                  <p>After the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he returned into <hi>England,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Reigning, he was ſoon received under her Princely Protection, being appointed one of the Diſputants about Points of Religion; and that once paſt, he was ſent into the <hi>Weſt</hi> to Viſit the Churches, where he uſed his utmoſt Diligence to Eſtabliſh the true Religion, and ſo prevailed, that by the Grace of God he Converted many hundreds to the way of Saving Knowledg: When upon his Return, he Preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, taking his Text the 1. of <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>For I received of the Lord that which alſo, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto you,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>In his Family he kept ſuch a ſtrict Obſervance of Religion, that every Evening at eight of the Clock, he was wont to call upon his Servants to perform their Duty to Heaven, and then going to Bed, ſome one of his Chaplains were wont to Read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part of the Lives of the Fathers, or ſome other Godly Author; which ended, he would Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf to the Protection of the Almighty, and ſo Repoſe himſelf.</p>

                  <p>In his Sickneſs, going to Preach, he was deſired by a Gentleman to return home; the Gentleman alledging that one Sermon was better to be loſt, than by his Impairing his Health to loſe ſo good a Paſtor: But his Reply was, that it beſt became a Biſhop to dye Preaching in a Pulpit, that his great Maſter the Lord Jeſus's Words might be fulfilled, who ſay's, <hi>Happy art thou my Servant, if when I come I find thee ſo doing.</hi> And thus continued this good Man, till his Sickneſs encreaſing, and Nature viſibly decaying in him, he was obliged to take his Bed; and ſo far was he from fearing Death, that he rather deſired, as longing to enter his Maſters Joy, often repeating the Words of old <hi>Simeon: Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> When as one ſtanding by prayed for his Recovery, which he hearing, ſaid, I have not ſo lived that I am aſhamed to live longer, neither do I fear to dye, becauſe we have a merciful Lord; a Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is laid up for me, Chriſt is my Righteouſneſs.

                     <hi>HEnry Bullinger</hi> was Born at a Town in <hi>Helvetia</hi> called <hi>Bremogart, Anno Chriſti</hi> 1504, coming of Honourable Parents, whoſe noble Progenitors had long flouriſhed in thoſe Parts; and in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood having eſcaped many eminent Dangers, he was ſent to <hi>Embrick,</hi> where under ſeveral School-Maſters he greatly Profited in Learning, eſpecially in the Knowledg of the Scriptures, continuing his Studies with great Eagerneſs: When being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to enter into a ſtrict way of Living, he was ſeveral times about to enter into a Monaſtery of Carthuſians, yet firſt he took time to debate on the Matter, and coming to <hi>Cologne,</hi> where he had Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Library of the Predicants, he Read the Lives of the Fathers, and Modern Divines: When finding all their Rules and Methods were taken from the Scripture, he left the Stream to take a View of the Fountain; and by ſeriouſly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thoſe Holy Pages, he at laſt found that they were altogether Repugnant to the Errors and Superſtitions of the Romiſh Church; whereupon he altered his Determination of turning Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, and diligently applyed himſelf to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one <hi>Stephen Malancthone</hi>'s Book of common Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in a while he Commenced Maſter of Arts; after which, at his Fathers Requeſt, he returned Home, and continued there for a good Space, yet neglected not his Studies; and his Fame ſpreading amongſt the Churches, he was ordained to read
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57946:150"/>
Lectures, and to Inſtruct the Younger Sort in the Knowledg of the Tongues, which he performed with great Diligence. When by the Abbot of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pela</hi> he was Inveſted a Preacher, he by his Sermons ſo far Prevailed, that he wrought a great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and cauſed ſeveral Traditions to be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
                  <p>Having continued in his former Station for ſome Years, he was called to the Paſtorſhip of <hi>Bremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart,</hi> where he by the Purity of his Doctrine ſo far prevailed with the Magiſtrates, that they Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Popery, and made many ſevere Decrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, Adultery, and other ſuch heinous Crimes; he alſo Confuted the Anabaptiſts, who at that time greatly troubled the Peace of the Church, denying the Payment of Tenths under the Goſpel, the which by publick Diſputation he proved Lawful.</p>
                  <p>But Satan Envying the Progreſs of the Goſpel, ſtirred up the Papiſts to Diſturb the Churches: And ſuch was the Tumult, that notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi>'s Exhorting them to Peace, or to try which was in the Right by Diſputation, they would not harken to it, but raiſed Forces on both ſides; and it coming to a Battle, the Proteſtants were worſted; whereupon Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi> and his Father were forced to fly to <hi>Zurick,</hi> where the Former was kindly Entertained by <hi>Leo Judel</hi> a Pious Man, and Promoted by the Conſent of the Citizens to Preach in the great Church, which he did for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Months, and thereby gained great Applauſe, being choſen Paſtor in the Stead of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed in a Battle between the Popiſh and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cantons. His greateſt Care was to maintain Peace and Unity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:57946:150"/>And now being ſetled in his Vocation, he wrote a Confeſſion of Faith, which being highly approved of by the Senate, it was ordered that it ſhould be Read in all their Churches at certain times: He there cauſed a Colledg to be Erected at the publick Charge, and took great care in Furniſhing it with ſuch Neceſſaries as were Convenient.</p>
                  <p>About this time, one <hi>Schewenfield</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> Taught that Chriſt's Body being received into Heaven, was ſo far Deified that it no longer contains its Humane Nature. To confute which <hi>Bullinger</hi> wrote a learned Treatiſe, proving by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it was a dangerous Error.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Luther</hi> Exclaimed againſt the Helvetian Churches, calling the Profeſſors Sacramentarians; <hi>Bullinger</hi> did all he could to perſwade him to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Peace, and a good Opinion; but not being able to prevail, he wrote this Declaration in the Defence of the Churches. <hi>We cannot,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>with</hi> Luther <hi>Confeſs Bread to be the Natural Body of Chriſt, and that</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das <hi>and other wicked Men received his Body as well as</hi> Peter, <hi>and the reſt of the Saints; yet are we ready, to preſerve Peace, ſo that it be not urged upon us, to yield to thoſe things, which neither our ſelves do <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor can we teach them to others: In all other things you ſhall find us willing to Comply, and to be peacible Men ready to give an Account of our Faith, whenſoever it ſhall be required of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Declaration ſatisfied many that before were diſpleaſed, by reaſon of his Anſwering one of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Books, whom they ſaid had deſerved ſo well of the Church.</p>
                  <p>A while after the Proteſtant Prince wrote to the Proteſtant Cantons to ſend them Aid againſt the Emperor; but <hi>Bullinger</hi> returned Anſwer, <hi>That
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57946:151"/>
they could not do it without Prejudicing them, for,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>both the Emperor and Pope have written to the Popiſh Cantons our Neighbours, to Aſſiſt them, which they have declined to do, upon no other Account than that we have not lent the Proteſtants any Aſſiſtance, the which if we once do, aſſure your ſelves they will raiſe all their Power to Aſſiſt the Popiſh Army: But we dayly Pray for your Succeſs, and keep many Faſts on your Behalf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi> had lived a while at <hi>Zurick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> came thither, and was kindly entertained by Mr. <hi>Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> when as the Emperor cauſed the Interim to be publiſhed in order to the Overthrowing the Proteſtant Religion, which <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, but the Printer durſt not let it come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, yet the Baniſhment of many good Miniſters Inſued, to the great Grief of the Churches.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Francis</hi> the French King was dead, and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navar</hi> Succeeded, he ſent to the Helveti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to renew the former League with them; but Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi> perſwaded them to the contrary; ſaying, <hi>It was neither Juſt nor Lawful for a Man to be hired to ſhed another Man's Blood, who might be Innocent, and from whom himſelf had never received any Injury,</hi> Whereupon the King miſſed of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1550, he publiſhed his famous <hi>Decades Sermonum,</hi> and ſent many of them into <hi>England,</hi> which greatly furthered the Reformation under Pious King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: He alſo wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> proving therein many Erroneous Decrees Repugnant to the Word of God; he likewiſe uſed his utmoſt Diligence to ſettle the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> there having ſome Difference
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57946:151"/>
Sprung up by the Teaching of one <hi>Bolſecus</hi> and his Followers, and when in the Perſecution of the Proteſtants under Queen <hi>Mary</hi> many fled to <hi>Zurick,</hi> he plentifully provided for them, and was very Zealous for the Defence of the Proteſtant Religion, uſing his utmoſt Diligence to Expunge the Bludra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Hereſy, which beginning in <hi>Poland,</hi> had ſpread it ſelf into many parts of <hi>Helvetia;</hi> the Spreaders of it, Teaching that our Saviour was not Man.</p>
                  <p>A while after, he had a Conteſt with <hi>Brentius,</hi> between whom many Books and Writings paſſed, but at laſt they were Reconciled. The Popes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations coming out to Summon the Helvetian Miniſters to come to the Council of Trent, they refuſed it, alledging that it was not convenient (they being Proteſtants) for them to be at a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Council.</p>
                  <p>And now Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi> having ſpent himſelf with Labour and Study, fell Sick; but upon the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Churches, God was pleaſed to reſtore him at that time, but his Wife and one of his Daughters dyed of the Peſtilence; and the next Year two more of his Children, himſelf being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo grievouſly Afflicted with the Stone, yet wrote he his Confeſſion of Faith, and ſent it to the Churches: He alſo Confuted the Pope's Bull which he ſent into <hi>England</hi> to Deprive Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of her Royal Eſtate, Proving it too Impious and Heretical.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1571, by reaſon of the Extremity of the Winter a Dearth Inſued, whereupon the Synod decreed publick Prayers and Faſting through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Territories, which was done with great Solemnity; and the next Year happened the cruel Maſſacree in <hi>France,</hi> where by the Hands of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57946:152"/>
bloody Papiſts, fell to the Number of 20000 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, upon which Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi> wrote his Book of Perſecution, and God's Judgment upon the Perſecutors; Exhorting the Perſecuted to Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Conſtancy: And about that time a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commet appeared in <hi>Caſſiopeia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Year 1574 Mr. <hi>Bullinger</hi> again fell Sick, and his Diſeaſe Increaſing, many Godly Miniſters came to Viſit him, but ſome Months after he Recovered and Preached as formerly, but ſoon Relapſed; when finding his Vital Spirits waſted, and Nature much decayed in him, he concluded his Death was at hand, and thereupon ſaid as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Lord will make any further <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of me and my Miniſtry in his Church, I will willingly obey him, but if he pleaſes (as I much deſire) to take me out of this miſerable Life, I ſhall exceedingly Rejoyce that he will be ſo pleaſed as to take me out of this Miſerable and Corrupt Age, to go to my Saviour Chriſt.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates (ſaid he) <hi>was glad when his Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he thought he ſhould go to</hi> Heſiod, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>and other learned Men Deceaſed, and whom he expected to meet in the other World: Then how much more do I Joy, who am ſure that I ſhall ſee my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, the Saints, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and all Holy Men which have lived from the beginning of the World. Theſe</hi> (I ſay) <hi>I am ſure to ſee, and to partake with them in Joy; why then ſhould not I be willing to Dye, to Injoy their perpetual Society in Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſending for all the Miniſters of <hi>Zurick,</hi> he recommended to them the Care of the Church, Admoniſhed them to Unity and Concord, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them ſharply to reprehend Sin, and beware of Drunkenneſs, but above all to reſpect the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57946:152"/>
who had been ſuch great Encouragers of the Proteſtant Religion, and from whom, next Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they muſt expect their Protection: And then with Tears told them, <hi>That he was not unwilling to leave them for his own Sake, but for the Sake of the Church.</hi> Then having written his Farewel to the Senate, and therein Admoniſhed them to take Care of the Churches and Schools, and by their Permiſſion Choſen one <hi>Ralph Gualter</hi> his Succeſſor: He patiently Reſigned up his Spirit into the Hands of his Redeemer, dying <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1575, and of his Age 71, to the great Grief of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, being a Man of ſingular Parts, a ſound Preacher, and an Eſtabliſher of the Helvetian Church. He wrote many Books, and Commented largly upon the Scripture, being a great Oppoſer of the Anabaptiſts, and an intire Lover of all good Men.</p>

                     <hi>JOhn Fox</hi> was Born in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> at the Town of <hi>Boſton Anno</hi> 1517, who was no ſooner brought up, but he was by his Parents ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there entred in <hi>Brazen-Noſe Colledg,</hi> where he aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated himſelf with Dr. <hi>Nowell,</hi> and ſo increaſed in Learning that he became the Wonder of his Age; ſo that within a while he was choſen Fellow of <hi>Magdalen Colledg,</hi> and won great Applauſe by the many excellent Latin Themes he wrote; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57946:153"/>
his Time chiefly to the Study of Divine Things; and finding out the many Errors in the Popiſh Religion, he began to affect the Reformed Doctrine; and ſtill increaſing in Learning and Wiſdom, he wrote againſt the Popes Supremacy, which cauſed the Papiſts greatly to inveigh againſt him, uſing their utmoſt Diligence to find out an Occaſion of Quarrel againſt him; and at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far, that he was examined about the Points of Religion, and Commanded to give a Confeſſion of his Faith, the which he refuſed not to do, as alſo to prove it out of the Scripture: Yet that was not prevalent with his Adverſaries, for they Condemned him for an Heretick, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him the Colledg; whereupon he departed into <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and there was entertained by Sr. <hi>Thomas Lucie,</hi> and became a Tutor to his Children, where he married a Wife and continued in great Reputation, till ſuch time as the Popiſh Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors came into thoſe Parts, for Fear of whom he was forced to withdraw himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And now being deſtitute, he ſent to his Father-in-Law, that had married his Mother, to know if he would entertain him, but he having got his Eſtate, made it a Pretence to Defraud him of it, that <hi>He was Convicted and a dangerous Perſon, and that unleſs he would Renounce his Opinions, he durſt not entertain him;</hi> yet his Mother ſo far prevail'd, that he found Reception, his Wife going to her own Father, whither Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> came often to viſit her: Yet could he not long be ſheltered from his Perſecutors, for by their Spies they got Knowledg of his Aboad, which cauſed him to go for <hi>London,</hi> where he fell into extream Poverty; inſomuch that half Starved as he was, he looked like a Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liton,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57946:153"/>
when one day ſitting in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, a Perſon to him unknown, came to him, and put a Sum of Mony into his Hand, bidding him go and be Merry, and within a ſhort time expect Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This he took as ſent from Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned all Praiſe to God, for his Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards him.</p>
                  <p>Within three Days after the Dutcheſs of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> ſent for him, and appointed him Tutor to the Earl of <hi>Purry</hi>'s Children, who were then in her Charge, who ſo much profited by his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that in Learning they Excelled all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Youth of the Kingdom; and he continued with good liking the Remainder of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s and all King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, being greatly Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in Reforming the Church, and Reſtoring it to its Primitive Purity in the Reign of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which got him more ill Will amongſt the Papiſts. So that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> coming to the Crown, and all things being turned topſi-turvy, <hi>Gardener</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> his profeſſed Enemy, uſed his utmoſt Diligence to bring him into a Snare; but he was defended againſt him a conſiderable time by the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who when he deſired to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for fear of the Perſecution, told him <hi>That he had yet Wealth, Favour, and Friends, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his Houſe: And if any Miſchance prevailed farther, that himſelf would partake of the Danger, and make the Deſtruction mutual: That he remembred with what Inſtructions he had Fortified his younger Years, neither had he with more Attention hearkened thereto, then he would with Conſtancy put them in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſuch was the Malice of his Enemies, that the Duke ſoon perceived his Power too weak to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57946:154"/>
Protect him, whereupon he provided him with ſuch Neceſſaries as were convenient, and ſent him to a Farmers Houſe, one of the Duke's Tenants, near <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> whither alſo his Wife went with him, reſolving to attend him in his Flight, altho ſhe was then great with Child.</p>
                  <p>After they had ſtaid a while there, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to paſs the Seas, but had ſcarce weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor when ſuch a Tempeſt aroſe that all the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners began to fear, and the Night being Dark, ſuch prodigious Storms of Hail and Rain fell, that they loſt the uſe of their Compaſs; and after being toſſed about forty eight Hours, the Ship was forced back into the ſame Port from whence ſhe firſt ſet Sail; which many took for a Token of God's being Diſpleaſed at his Flight: Yet Providence ſo ordered it, that whilſt the Ship was toſſing upon the Ocean, he eſcaped a worſe Danger on Land, for <hi>Gardiner</hi> had ſent a Purſevant with Commiſſion to bring him back, who having ſearched the Farme Houſe, and underſtanding that he was on Board, and that the Veſſel had ſet Sail ſome Hours, before, he returned to him that ſent him, ere the Ship was driven into the Port.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> being Landed took Horſe, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ride for <hi>London,</hi> but in the Night he came on Board again, and the Ship hoiſing Sail, paſſed the dangerous Seas ſafely arriving at <hi>Newport,</hi> where he Landed, and after having refreſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he together with his Wife and ſome others, went to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Baſile,</hi> which was then a Place of free Reception of poor diſtreſſed Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who were forced to leave their Countries for the Sake of the Lord Jeſus, and his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel: And here he undertook to Correct the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57946:154"/>
Preſs, and at ſuch leiſure times as he could ſpare, he Wrote part of the Acts and Monuments of the Church, a Work famous to all Poſterity: And in this Station he continued till the Death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Death he had a little before fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, upon certain Notice of which, he with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pious and Learned Men returned into <hi>England,</hi> and were kindly received by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then Reigning; where Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> proſecuted his Work begun at <hi>Baſil,</hi> and ſo laboured therein that he ſoon brought it to a Period, which made the Papiſts yet more inveigh againſt him, and endeavour what in them lay to diſparage both him and it; but he ſo fully Confuted them, that with Shame and Confuſion of Face they were forced to give over. He finiſhing this great Work in eleven Years ſpace, ſearching all the Records himſelf, and by his great Study and Travail therein much weakened his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet for the good of the Church he ſpared no Pains. So that now his Fame being ſpread abroad, many who retained Doubts and Scruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as well Nobles as Plebeians, reſorted to him, to ſatisfy them, and diſſolve their Anxieties, the Concourſe being daily very great: With ſome he Prayed, to others he declared the Will of the Almighty out of the Holy Scriptures, and ſo found Means to give them full Satisfaction, even draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of many, by the Aſſiſtance of God's Divine Grace, out of the Mouth of Satan: Nor did he ſpare to Preach abroad, and uſe all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to promote the Goſpel; and ſo fervent were his Prayers, that they had a more then common Influence upon the Hearers, and he with <hi>David</hi> through the Sence of his Sin was always wont to <hi>Water his Couch with Tears.</hi>

                  <p>One Day he going to Viſit the Lady <hi>Henage,</hi> who being Sick of a Feaver, and given over by her Phyſicians, after he had Prayed by her, he told her <hi>She had done well to prepare her ſelf for Death, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe ſhould not dye of that Sickneſs.</hi> Whereupon her Son in-Law ſaid, <hi>He had not done well to diſquiet her with Hopes of Life, when ſhe had been given over by the Learned Phyſicians:</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that <hi>He ſaid no more then was Commanded him, for it ſeemed good to God that ſhe ſhould Recover, which within a ſhort time, ſhe accordingly did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Mrs. <hi>Honywood</hi> having layn Sick of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and deep Melancholly, for the Space of twenty Years, ſent for Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> to Pray with her, as being given up by all the Phyſicians for Dead; the which when he had done, he told her ſhe ſhould not only Recover, but live many Years; at which ſhe earneſtly looking on him, and having a Glaſs in her Hand: Said, <hi>You might as well have told me, that if I throw this Glaſs againſt the Wall it will not break,</hi> and with that ſhe threw it with all her Force: Yet although it hit againſt a Poſt, afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Cheſt, and then on the Floor, it neither broke, nor had ſo much as a Flaw in it; and as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaid, ſo it happened, for ſhe ſoon recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and lived twenty Years after, although ſhe at that time was near ſeventy Years old.</p>
                  <p>One Day he having been to Viſit the Earl of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel</hi> at the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Houſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:57946:155"/>
the Earl went with him to the back Stairs, where he was to take Water, but the Thames being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Rough, the Earl diſſwaded him from ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing. To which Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> reply'd, <hi>My Lord, ſo let theſe Waters deal with me, as I have in Truth and Sincerity delivered unto you all that I have ſpoken:</hi> Which done he entered the Boat, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the winds ceaſed, and there was a great Calm. The reaſon of his ſo ſaying to the Earl was, becauſe he had formerly been his Tutor, and had inſtructed him in the Principles of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>He now growing in Years, and by reaſon of his former Hardſhips, his great Study, Travail, and Labour, he was reduced to a very weak Condition, he laid down the troubleſom Cares of the World, to prepare himſelf for Death: And foreſeeing his End was at hand, leſt his Sons ſhould be troubled, he ſent them abroad, and then after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fervent Prayers for the Church, and the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Goſpel, he reſigned up his Spirit into the Hands of the Father of all Spirits; dying <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1587, and of his Age 70.</p>
                  <p>Some Paſſages of his are worthy of Note, he one Day going abroad, a poor Man paſſing along, he friendly Embraced and Relieved him; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded whether he knew him or not, he ſaid, <hi>Yes truly, I remember him well, and forget Lords and Ladys to remember ſuch.</hi>

                  <p>An other time, as he was going through <hi>Cannon-Street,</hi> it being in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he met a Woman of his Acquaintance, who after ſome Diſcourſe, pulled a Bible out of her Pocket, telling him ſhe was going to Church.

                     <hi>EDmund Grindal</hi> was Born <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1519, at <hi>Beighs</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> of Godly Parents, and there brought up in all the Learning the Schools in thoſe Parts were capable to furniſh him withal, and then being fitted for the Univerſity, he went to <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and was admitted into <hi>Pembrook Hall,</hi> and ſo cloſely applyed himſelf to his Study, that he outpaſſed moſt of his Fellows, inſomuch that he was within a few Years after his coming thither Choſen a Fellow, and within a while after that, Maſter of the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>When as Biſhop <hi>Ridly</hi> coming to Viſit the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and taking Notice of his ſingular Piety and Learning, he appointed him one of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and afterwards Recommended him to King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, who ſet greatly by him, and was about to Prefer him to a Biſhoprick, but that he was prevented by Death.</p>
                  <p>This good Prince being Dead, and Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> coming to the Crown, he amongſt the reſt, was
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57946:156"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>HEnry</hi> the Eighth was ſecond Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and his Wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, Born <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1490, and was by the Prudent King his Father, during his Minority, committed to the Tutorage of ſeveral learned Men, and amongſt the reſt, Cardinal <hi>Wolſy</hi>'s, which was the firſt Riſe of that great Cardinal. After he was about thirteen Years of Age, his Brother Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> dyed, whereupon he was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Married to <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Brothers Wife; in which State he continued till <hi>Anno</hi> 1508, at what time his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh dyed, and he the ſame Day was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King of <hi>England, France,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>London</hi> and other Places of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and within a while after was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by <hi>William Warham</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> And thus being ſeated in the Throne of the Kingdom, the firſt remarkable thing he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57946:158"/>
did, was upon the grievous Complaint of ſeveral Perſons, to deliver up to publick Juſtice <hi>Empſom,</hi> and <hi>Dudly,</hi> two Judges, whom King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh uſed as his Inſtruments to Oppreſs the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by grievous Exactions; who being Convicted of many hainous Crimes, were Executed on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A while after, Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, being diſpleaſed with the French King, ſent his Legate to Incite our King <hi>Henry</hi> to demand the Dutches of <hi>Normandy, Guyen, Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> which he accordingly did, but was denyed with ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; whereupon he joyned with the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> againſt the French King, and equiping a gallant Fleet, he Landed an Army in <hi>France,</hi> and took <hi>Terwin,</hi> and <hi>Tournay</hi> by Seige; and then making <hi>Wolſey</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tournay,</hi> he returned into <hi>England,</hi> where he beſtowed ſeveral other Biſhopricks upon him.</p>
                  <p>During the Kings being in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>England</hi> under their King, <hi>James</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon Pretence of our Deſtroying one <hi>Andrew Barton,</hi> a Scotch Pirate, who had done great Miſchief at Sea. Againſt them, the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> and Lieutenant of the <hi>North,</hi> was ſent; who gave the Scots Battail at <hi>Foldon-Field,</hi> and put them to the Rout; Killing the King, three Biſhops, two Abbots, twelve Earls, about ſeventy Lords and Knights, and near eight thouſand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, taking almoſt as many Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>The French King hearing of theſe Proceedings, ſent his Ambaſſadors to Treat of a Peace: Which was Concluded upon that King's Marrying the lady <hi>Mary,</hi> our Kings ſecond Siſter; yet he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed her not long, for within three Months after
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57946:159"/>
the Marriage he dyed; and then <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> being ſent to fetch her over, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Married her at <hi>Calis,</hi> which had nigh cauſed him to loſe the King's Favour; She having for <hi>Dover,</hi> out of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> thirty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns yearly during Life, and one hundred Thouſand to be paid for five Years, to the King her Brother.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Julius</hi> being Dead, and <hi>Leo</hi> Succeeding him, he upon Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>'s ſending good ſtore of Gold to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent him a Cardinal's Cap: And now Strangers growing very Unruly in <hi>London,</hi> at the Inſtigation of one <hi>Lincoln,</hi> a great Tumult happened on <hi>May</hi> Eve, who Plundered and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Houſes of many Strangers in St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines Legrand,</hi> and other places; the Uprore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing for near two Days; whereupon a power being ſent into the City, many of them were Taken, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Lincoln</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were Executed on Gibbets ſet up in moſt Streets, and four Hundred Youth, and twelve Women, went to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with Halters about their Necks, and were at the Inſtance of <hi>Wolſey</hi> Pardoned; and from that time, ever ſince, the Day of that Inſurrection is called <hi>Evil-May Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King for the Sum of ſix hundred Thouſand Crowns, and other Gratuities, about this time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up <hi>Turnay</hi> to the French, altho the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Perſwaded him from it: But the French ſoon breaking Truce, the King ſoon prepared for War, and joyning with the Emperor and ſome other Princes; and then the Emperor Coming into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it was agreed that when the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> came of Years, the Emperor ſhould take her to Wife: And thereupon the Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> was ſent with a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57946:159"/>
great Power into <hi>France,</hi> who took <hi>Morlois,</hi> and burnt ſeveral Towns and Villages on the Sea Coaſt, and ſo returned into <hi>England</hi> with great Spoils; when as the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was ſent with a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Army againſt the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but by the Mediation of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, a Truce was concluded ere it could come to a Battail, yet a while after, the Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> being made Lord Admiral of the North, entred that Kingdom, and did great Harm, inſomuch that a War was proclaimed: For the better Management of which, a Parliament was called in <hi>England,</hi> and at the Inſtigation of <hi>Wolſey,</hi> the half of all Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Livings were granted to the King for five Years, and a Tenth of all temporal Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> being Expelled his Kingdom, by his rebellious Subjects, came about this time into <hi>England,</hi> and was nobly entertained at the King's Charge, for the ſpace of three Weeks, and then he departed for <hi>Flanders:</hi> And the French growing Inſolent, the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with an Army, who Fought the French, beat them, took many Towns, and returned with great Booty: And now by the Mediation of <hi>Margret,</hi> Queen of Scots, and Siſter to King <hi>Henry;</hi> a firm Peace was Concluded between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> of which <hi>Wolſey</hi> taking the Advantage, as knowing when there was War, it was gainful to him; he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch Diligence, that he withdrew the King from the Emperor's Intereſt, as alſo cauſed him to decline the Payment of the Annual Penſion to the Duke of <hi>Burbon;</hi> whereupon he with his Army went to <hi>Rome,</hi> fought the French, took their King, and entred the City with his Victorious Army, and Beſieged Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> and twenty three Cardinals
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57946:160"/>
in the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Angelo,</hi> which News com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Wolſey,</hi> he ſolicited the King to ſend an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to deliver the Pope out of that eminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but the King would only conſent to grant a conſiderable Sum of Money, to be imployed in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Italian Forces. But the Pope notwithſtanding his Bulls, Curſes with Bell, Book, and Candle, found his Gold moſt Powerful; for with that he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Duke's Departure: and altho by the Popes Procurement he was Condemned of Treaſon, yet he maugered the Malice of that proud Prelate, and laughed him to Scorn.</p>
                  <p>Things being at this Paſs, the Earl of <hi>Tyrowen</hi> Rebelled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt whom the great Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> was ſent, with a powerful Army, who ſoon cauſed the Rebels to Vaniſh; whereupon the Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> was made Deputy, but within a ſhort time diſplaced, and the Earl of <hi>Kilder</hi> placed in his Stead, againſt whom <hi>Wolſey</hi> ſhew'd him an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemy, and thereby loſt much of the King's Favour.</p>
                  <p>The Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> the King's eldeſt Daughter, being arrived at ſeven Years, the King ſent to put the Emperor in mind of his Promiſe, but he not greatly liking her, by reaſon of her want of Beauty, and not knowing well, how to revoke his Promiſe, he by his Ambaſſadors, began to queſtion her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy, alledging that ſhe being Born of that Marriage which was Contracted with a Brothers Wife, and that conſequently not Lawful, ſhe could not be Legitimate.</p>
                  <p>The King hearing theſe Objections, began to fall into a Diſlike of that Marriage, and thereupon calling many of the chief Clergy together, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Reſentments; whereupon they adviſed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57946:160"/>
him to ſue out a Divorce in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he attempted with great Coſt: But finding many wilful Delays, he convened the Clergy of this Kingdom, but Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> would not meddle therein, unleſs a Cardinal was ſent to joyn with him in Commiſſion; whereupon, at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, Cardinal <hi>Campejus</hi> was ſent by the Pope, with Power to erect a Court, there to hear the King's Objections, which was done accordingly, at a vaſt Charge, and thither the King and Queen were Cited, and many Debates held; ſo that at laſt all Men thinking it would have come to an Iſſue, and nothing remained but the determinatory Sentence, for procuring a Divorce, <hi>Campejus</hi> Adjorned the Proceeding to be heard in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Sentence to the Determination of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe Proceedings of the two Cardinals, the King was highly Incenſed; Ordered <hi>Campejus</hi> to depart the Land, and for ſome Days after <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> was forbid to come into his Preſence; when as having conſulted <hi>Cranmer</hi> about the Matter, he ſent him to <hi>Rome,</hi> who there ſo learnedly Diſputed and Proved out of Scripture, and the Writings of the Fathers, that it was not Lawful for a Brother to Marry a Brothers Wife; that none would, or at leaſt could, Argue againſt the many Reaſons he Propounded; and returning, then he went to all the famous Univerſities of <hi>Italy, Germany, Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and deſired the Advice of the chief Doctors, who all concurred with him, in his Opinion: So that returning Home with their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions in Writing, under the Seals of the ſeveral Univerſities; the King was ſo highly pleaſed, that he Inveſted him in the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57946:161"/>
and put away Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> whereupon the Pope ſent out his Bull to declare the Marriage Lawful, but the King not regarding it; not only Married the Lady <hi>Ann Bullin,</hi> Daughter to the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Rochford,</hi> but likewiſe in a Parliament he then called, aboliſhed the Pope's Supremacy, and by Act of Parliament, had his ſecond Marriage Confirmed.</p>
                  <p>And now Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> being arrived at the height of Greatneſs, for oppoſing the King in theſe his proceedings; began more and more to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diſgrace; and for a terrible Example, to deter others from Murmuring, Sr. <hi>Thomas More</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> were Beheaded, for diſowning the Kings Supremacy in Spiritual Affairs; and ſeveral Articles drawn up againſt the Cardinal, all his Dignities Sequeſtered, and his Perſon Arreſted at <hi>Lawood,</hi> about ſeven Miles from <hi>York,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in order to his being brought up to <hi>London,</hi> to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Charge, but by the way, Lodging at <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter Abby,</hi> he dyed, as 'tis thought, of exceſſive Grief; though ſome are of Opinion, he poiſoned himſelf, becauſe he would not live to ſee the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace he muſt needs undergo: His laſt Words be, <hi>If I had ſerved my God, ſo faithfully as I have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my King, he would not at this time have caſt me off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a Man of a haughty Spirit, being at firſt raiſed, from being a poor School-Maſter, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh: He during the younger Years of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, Ruled the Kingdom in Effect, and heaped up to him ſuch Infinite Treaſure, that 'tis reported he ſent twelve Barrels full of Gold and Silver to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that for the building his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57946:161"/>
two Colledges, he Suppreſſed fourty Monaſteries, and in his Writings uſually Subſcribed, <hi>I and my King,</hi> and upon moſt of the King's Money cauſed the Cardinal's Cap to be Stamped.</p>
                  <p>And now one <hi>Elizabeth Barton</hi> a Popiſh Imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commonly called the Holy Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> pretended to have Revelations from Heaven; and thereupon declared that it was Revealed to her, that if the King proceeded in his ſecond Marriage, he ſhould not Reign a Month, whereupon ſhe and ſeven of her Diſciples being Attainted of high Treaſon, were Executed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Pope growing Impatient at the loſs of ſuch a ſweet Morſel, as the Revenue of <hi>England,</hi> by his Agents endeavoured to ſtir up the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Princes againſt our King <hi>Henry,</hi> and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, King of Scots, his Nephew, promiſing the Crown to thoſe that could catch it; but his Attempts proved Ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>And now ſo far prevail the Popelings, that they endeavoured to wreck their Revenge againſt all that had been for the Obliterating the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, bringing many into Diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>About this time Queen <hi>Ann</hi> was delivered of the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> afterwards Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the next Year of a Child Still Born: But this good Lady favouring the Reformed Religion, the Court-Papiſts, and eſpecially bloody <hi>Gardiner,</hi> ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bribed thoſe that Attended her; whereupon they Accuſed her of Committing Inceſt with her Brother the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> whereupon they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Noris, Weſton, Brierton,</hi> and <hi>Marks,</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Privy Chamber, were ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and within a while after, all of them beheaded, as 'tis ſuppoſed, to make way for a new Love, for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57946:162"/>
the next Day the King was Married to the Lady <hi>Jane Seymer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the King being deſtitute of a Privado, whereto he might impart his weighty Secrets, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> Son to a Black-Smith, born at <hi>Putny,</hi> he having been formerly a Servant to <hi>Wolſey;</hi> firſt Knighting him, then created him Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Barron of <hi>Okeham,</hi> Maſter of his <hi>Jewel-Houſe,</hi> Knight of the <hi>Garter,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Lord high Chamberlain, and laſtly Vicar General: This Man was God's Inſtrument in the Hand of the King, to Suppreſs Popery, and Cheriſh the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, uſing his utmoſt Diligence to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Images, Idols, Popiſh Trinkets, and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; but the Devil Envying his Happineſs, for Oppoſing the Encreaſe of his Kingdom, he ſtirred up <hi>Gardiner</hi> againſt him, with ſeveral Popiſh Biſhops, who notwithſtanding his Warineſs, and upright Dealing, ſo far prevailed againſt him, that they brought him into the King's Diſpleaſure, and then puſhing on their Malicious Deſign, cauſed him to loſe his Head; of whoſe Death the King often Repented him, wiſhing many times, that he had his <hi>Cromwel</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>The Fryers and Monks being unhived, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Roaſtmeat, grew Impatient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſtirred up the unthinking Mobile in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> to take Arms, but upon Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of free Pardon, they laid them down without Bloodſhed, but the Monks being Impatient, and finding the Inſtability of the Plebeans, they dealt with thoſe of Rank, whereupon an Inſurrection was Headed by the Lord <hi>Darcy,</hi> Lord <hi>Huſſye,</hi> Sr: <hi>Robert Conſtable,</hi> Sr. <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi> Sr. <hi>Frances Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi> Sr. <hi>Stephen Hambleton,</hi> Sr. <hi>John Bulmer,</hi> the

Abbot of <hi>Fountaines,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Rivax,</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Gervaulks,</hi> and Prior of <hi>Burlington,</hi> all of which being taken, were Executed in ſeveral Parts of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time Queen <hi>Jane</hi> was brought to Bed of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> afterwards King of <hi>England,</hi> but dying in Childbed, the King lamented her Death grievouſly, whereupon he continued a Widdower for the ſpace of two Years, and then was affianced to the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> but upon her firſt Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the King took a Diſlike to her Perſon, and therefore never Bedded her; but within a ſhort time procured a Divorce to paſs in Parliament, and was Married to the Lady <hi>Catharine Howard,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward,</hi> Brother to <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> But whether True, or through the Malice of the Popiſh Party, is uncertain, after her ſix Months Marriage ſhe was Accuſed of Adultry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, together with the Lady <hi>Jane Rochford,</hi> and ſome other of the Privy-Chamber, was Beheaded within the Tower.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Year the Lords <hi>Grey</hi> and <hi>Dacres, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and others, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Beheaded, and the King, who was now grown Old, began to think him of an other Wife, and thereupon was Married to <hi>Katharine Par.</hi>

                  <p>The Parliament again ſitting, it was Enacted high Treaſon for any one to deny the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or to acknowledg the Pope: And by this Parliament, the ſix bloody Articles were Confirmed, and it was made Hereſy and Death to deny any of them; the which were as followeth: Firſt, That after ſpeaking the Words of Conſecration by the Prieſt, the real and natural Body and Blood of Chriſt, as he was Conceived and Crucified, was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57946:163"/>
in the Sacrament, and no other Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Communion in both Kinds, is not neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Prieſts may not Marry.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That Vows of Chaſtity ought to be Obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That Private Maſs ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That Auricular Confeſſion is neceſſary, and requiſit to be retained in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Articles having paſſed both Houſes, and ſigned by the King, many good Chriſtians refuſed to ſhape their Conſciences according to Tenour thereof, and therefore not a few Suffered the Flames, and by other Means put to Death.</p>
                  <p>The Scots again Invading <hi>England,</hi> and their King having made one <hi>Oliver</hi> St. <hi>Clere,</hi> an upſtart Favourite, General, the Nobility ſo much diſdeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Command, that out of Hatred to him, they willingly loſt the Battail, almoſt without Fighting, which King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, took ſo grievouſly, that he fell into a Feavour and Dyed, and ſoon after a Peace for ten Years was Concluded, upon Condition that the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> King <hi>James</hi>'s only Child, ſhould be given in Marriage to <hi>Edward,</hi> Heir to our King <hi>Henry:</hi> But by the Diſſwaſion of the Pope and French King, they kept not their Promiſe; whereupon the King prepared two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Warred on both Nations: His Army in <hi>France</hi> taking <hi>Buloin,</hi> and ſeveral other Places of Importance; and that in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Burnt the City of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> and made great Havock in the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Countries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1545, a Councel was held at <hi>Trent,</hi> which by Adjornments was continued till 1563, during

the Popedoms of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, <hi>Julian</hi> the Third, and <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, and was the Eighteenth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council.</p>
                  <p>The King having formerly wrote a Book againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> for which he had the Title of Defender of the Faith, ſent him by the Pope: Now Wrote a Book againſt the Pope, laying open his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Envy, Breach of League, Stirring up of princes to War, and cauſing Subjects to Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their lawful Prince.</p>
                  <p>And now the Monaſteries, Fryeries, Pryeries, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Nunneries went to wrack; there being Suppreſſed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries 313, Pryories 290, Fryeries 122, Nunneries 142, Colledges 152, and Hoſpitals 129, in all 1148. The Valuation thereof (altho at half the Worth) as they were preſented to the King, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, at the time of their Suppreſſion, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one hundred eighty three thouſand ſeven hundred ſeven Pounds and thirteen Shillings. Yet the Lands were ſo Imbezeled and Diſtributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Courtiers, and Annexed to Mannors, that the King's Exchequer was not much Increaſed thereby.</p>
                  <p>And now the King much decaying by reaſon of grievous Sickneſs, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 28th. of <hi>January. Anno</hi> 1546, gave up the Ghoſt in the 56 Year of his Age, and 38 of his Reign, and was Buried in <hi>Windſor Chappel;</hi> altho a ſtately Monument was Contrived for him in <hi>Weſtminſter Abby,</hi> but through the Troubles that afterwards happened, it was left Unfiniſhed.</p>

                     <hi>EDward Tuder,</hi> afterwards King of <hi>England,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, was born, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1537. and was the only Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by his third Wife <hi>Jane</hi> Daughter to Sir <hi>John Seymer,</hi> who loſt her Life to give him Birth; for being caſt into a dead ſleep, or her ſences benum'd with powerful Spirits, her Belly was open'd, of which Inciſion within four days after ſhe dyed.</p>
                  <p>When he came to be ſix years of Age, he was committed to the Tutorage of Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cheek</hi> both learned and godly men; the firſt inſtructing him in Divinity, the latter in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; in both which (being of a moſt acute Wit) he grew ſo perfect, that he became the wonder of his Age, for at ten years old he ſpake <hi>Latin, Greek, French, Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> very readily; he was likewiſe very skilful in <hi>Logick, Philoſophy, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> and <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was but nine years of Age, his Father King <hi>Henry</hi> dyed, and he was proclaimed King in <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> and other Places, and in great State conducted to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where his Unkle the Duke of <hi>Summerſet</hi> being Protector of the Kingdom (during his Minority) Knighted him, then the young King taking the Sword from his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57946:164"/>
Unkle Knighted the Lord Mayor, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and created his other Unkle, Sir <hi>Thomas Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Lord of <hi>Sudly,</hi> and High Admiral of <hi>England;</hi> and returning to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> he was crowned by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> all the Nobility attending, as is uſual upon the like occaſion, and the ſame day he cauſed a General Pardon to paſs the Broad Seal to all Perſons except ſix, who were named therein.</p>
                  <p>And now this Pious Prince being Eſtabliſhed in the Throne of his Father, bent his whole Study to the better ſetling Religion, and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with many Godly Divines about Reforming the Church, by whoſe aſſiſtance he ſo model'd the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, that the Dregs of Popery were purged out, and pious men every where commanded to teach according to the Word of God, all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Maſſing Garments, and other Trumpery were ſeaſed and burnt, and now not only the Pope's Supremacy, but the Popiſh Religion was aboliſhed, and the Doctors of the Reformed Churches invited over from <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Places, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came, as <hi>Bucer, Fagius, Peter Martyr,</hi> and others; ſo that the bright Rays of the Goſpel began to ſhine into the darkeſt corner of Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>A Parliament being called, the ſix Bloody Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (upon refuſing to comply with which about fifty Perſons ſuffered the Flames in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days) were revoked, and now the Parliament thought fit to proſecute the Marriage agreed on in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign, between the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and our King <hi>Edward;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Ambaſſadors were ſent to demand her, but the Regent declared that the Contract was void, which ſo incenſed the King and Parliament, that the Duke of <hi>Summerſet</hi> was ſent with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57946:165"/>
to <hi>Barwick;</hi> whereupon the Regent cauſed fire to be carried a croſs, and the Bells to be rung as is uſual amongſt the <hi>Scots</hi> upon any Invaſion; ſo that all the Kingdom roſe in Arms, yet the Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor not fearing their prodigious number, gave them battle, in which the <hi>Scots</hi> were overthrown, nine Dukes and Earls were ſlain, and about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of meaner rank; whereupon the Scottiſh Regent fearing that the Nobility would deliver up the Queen, he ſent her into <hi>France,</hi> there to be married to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> which ſo inraged the Engliſh, that they vowed the utter Subverſion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> deſtroying all before them with Fire and Sword in a moſt fearful manner, but by reaſon of ſome Inſurrections that happ'ned in <hi>England,</hi> the Duke was recalled.</p>
                  <p>In this Parliament likewiſe the Statutes of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the Second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, for ſuppreſſing the Scriptures in Engliſh, were repeal'd, and it was Enacted that the Church Service ſhould be read in Engliſh, and that the Bleſſed Sacrament ſhould be adminiſtred in both kinds, and that all Popiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſhould be aboliſhed; and thoſe that would not yield obedience to the Church, as it was now eſtabliſhed, to loſe their Places, and be puniſhed as Contemners of the Laws of the Kingdom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſeveral Popiſh Biſhops complied, and rather than they would leave their Biſhopricks choſe to ſwallow down any Oath that could be impoſed on them; others indeed went off, and made it their buſineſs to ſtir up the People to Rebellion, which they and their Agents effected in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwel,</hi> where great Tumults aroſe, there being at leaſt thirty thouſand in Arms at once, who did great Miſchief, beſeiging the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> which held
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57946:165"/>
out againſt them; whereupon the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was ſent down with an Army, as likewiſe the King's Pardon, which he firſt proclaimed by a Herauld up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition they would lay down their Arms and depart peaceably to their reſpective homes, which they refuſing, he gave them battle, and after four ſeveral overthrows took their Ring-leader, who being executed, the reſt ſubmitted.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner were the Tumults of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire</hi> ſuppreſſed, but one <hi>Robert Ket</hi> drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty thouſand of the Commons of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> to take up Arms againſt the King, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> did great hurt, but the Lord <hi>Dudly</hi> being ſent againſt them with an Army, gave them battle, and putting them to the rout, took <hi>Ket</hi> their Ring-leader, whom together with ſixty nine others he cauſed to be executed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Rebels were ſcarcely ſuppreſſed, when News came that the Commons of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> were up in Arms under the leading of one <hi>William Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi> a Farmer, <hi>Thomas Dale</hi> a Pariſh Clark, and one <hi>Stephenſon</hi> a Poſt-Maſter, but the King ſending down his pardon to all but the three before mentioned, theſe that they had ſeduced ſeeing their Folly, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the offered Mercy; ſo that their Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders being delivered up to Juſtice, they were carried to <hi>York,</hi> and there Executed.</p>
                  <p>But now what was more grievous, the Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall out amongſt themſelves, and eſpecially the King's Unkles, the firſt quarrel between them being about their Wives taking the upper hand, which grew to that height, notwithſtanding the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the young King, that the Lord Protector procured Articles to be drawn up againſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and getting them paſſed in Parliament, he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57946:166"/>
cauſed him to be Attainted of High Treaſon, and got the King to ſign a Warrant for his Death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was beheaded on Tower Hill; but the Protector by this means having untwiſted the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he was too weak to hold the Ship of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in ſo tempeſtuous a Sea, for by this Act having chalked out a Path to thoſe that envied his Greatneſs, they Articled againſt him, when upon his Tryal, he being aquitted of Treaſon, he was Attainted of Felony, and for that he headed, for which had not he been Infatigated, he might have had the Benefit of his Clergy.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Inteſtine Diſſentions, the Engliſh were driven out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the French at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the recovery of <hi>Bullogne,</hi> and at the ſame time Invade the Iſle of <hi>Garnſey,</hi> but were beaten off from either with conſiderable loſs.</p>
                  <p>And now theſe Great Peers being removed, the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> ruled all at Court, and every one moved according to his Dictates, few daring to controul his Will, and the King fell into deſperate Melancholy through immoderate Grief for the Deaths of his Unkles, to which he had been over-perſwaded to conſent, which made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan this Misfortune, in this manner. <hi>Ah,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>where was the good Nature of a Nephew? where was the Clemency of a Prince? Ah, how unfortunate have I been to thoſe of my Blood? my Mother I ſlew at my Birth, and ſince have made away two of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and unhappily to make way for the purpoſes of others, againſt my ſelf. Alaſs, how falſly have I been abuſed, how weakly carried, and how little was I Maſter of my own Judgment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed this latter part of his Speech proved Prophetick; for <hi>Northumberland</hi> having got the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57946:166"/>
Power, prevailed upon the weak King, to will the Kingdom to the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> to whom he had married his fourth Son, the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley</hi> on purpoſe to tranſlate the Soverainty to his Houſe, which the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented too, and then <hi>Northumberland</hi> removing all the King's Chirurgeons and Phyſicians, delivered him into the hands of a Woman, who undertaking to cure him, bereaved him of Life by Poyſon, or her unskilfulneſs, who a little before his Death was heard to pray, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord God, deliver me out of this miſerable and wretched Life, and take me amongſt thy choſen. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, not my Will, but thy Will be done. Lord, I commit my Spirit to thee. O Lord, thou knoweſt how happy it were for me to be with thee, yet for thy Choſen's ſake ſend me life and health, that I may truly ſerve thee. O my Lord God, bleſs thy People, and ſave thine Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. O Lord God, ſave thy choſen People of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>O my Lord God, defend the Realm from Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and maintain thy true Religion, that I and my People may praiſe thy Holy Name for thy Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake;</hi> and then looking about him, he perceived ſeveral Biſhops ſtanding at a diſtance, to whom he ſaid, <hi>I did not think you had been ſo nigh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And within a while after, he ſaid, <hi>I am faint, Lord, have mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit,</hi> and ſo gave up the Ghoſt, dying on the Twenty eighth of <hi>January, Anno</hi> 1553. and in the ſixteenth Year of his Age, having Reigned ſix Years, five Months, and eight Days, and was buried in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, being the 41 ſole Monarch.</p>
                  <p>He was a Prince ſo accompliſhed for Piety, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Learning, that conſidering his Age, he was the Wonder of the World, his Charity was

(at which time Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> coming into <hi>England</hi>) by his Perſwaſions they made an Act to reſtore the Popiſh Religion, and from him the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons received an Abſolution, which was no ſooner done, but the good Biſhops of the Reformed Church were Depoſed, Impriſoned, and Murthered, when as many Popiſh Wolves crept from their ſecret Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and were highly advanced, who ſo far Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Queen againſt the true Servants of God, that they had it in their power to deal with them as they liſt, and they according to the Scriptures, found the <hi>Mercies of the wicked cruel,</hi> for there were few Towns of note in <hi>England,</hi> where ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were not expoſed to the Flames, by whoſe couragious ſufferings, contrary to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the Adverſary, the Profeſſors of the Goſpel were greatly increaſed.</p>

                  <p>Although to prevent it, Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> had raiſed the Commons of <hi>Kent,</hi> thinking to have ſeized upon the Queen in the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> for which he and ſeventy three of his Partakers were Executed, of which Inſurrection the <hi>Poplings</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Queen, that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Siſter was the Cauſe; whereupon ſhe being brought

                  <p>Her Servants having provided her Diet, the

                  <p>But the next Day, the Lord <hi>Shandois</hi> came to her, and told her, he had obtained her that Liberty, and within a while after ſhe had Leave to walk into a little Garden, all the Dores being ſhut, and the Priſoners on that Side commanded not to look out, during her being there.</p>
                  <p>Within a while after, Sr. <hi>Henry Benefield,</hi> with a Guard of Northern Souldiers, took her into his Charge, the Conſtable of the <hi>Tower</hi> being diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Office; and altho the former was bad, this proved worſe, inſomuch that ſhe one Day demanded, whether the Lady <hi>Janes Scaffold</hi> was taken away, and farther, that if her private Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was Committed to <hi>Benefield;</hi> He was a Man of that Conſcience to ſee it done: To which her Servants Anſwered, they knew not what he was, but were fully perſwaded God would not ſuffer ſo great a Wickedneſs.

                  <p>Being thus Eſtabliſhed in his Throne, his firſt Care was to ſettle Religion, and the better to Effect it, he cauſed the Bible to be exactly Tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Engliſh, out of the Original Tongue, which ſtirred up the Popelings (who hoped upon the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to bring all things to their Purpoſe) greatly to Malign this good King, and uſed their utmoſt Diligence to Overthrow the Proteſtant Religion: But God diſcovered their Plots, which had they took Effect, were to Deſtroy the King and Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> for which ſeveral of the chief Contrivers were put to Death, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Condemned to perpetual Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>In the third Year of his Reign, that damnable Deſign of Blowing up the Parliament Houſe was Miraculouſly Diſcovered, by the Miſtake of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivered by an unknown Hand, to a Servant of the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> wherein he was wiſhed by any Means, not to be preſent at the Opening of the Parliament, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they ſhould receive a great Blow, but not know who hurt them. Upon the Peruſing of this Letter, the ſaid Lord Communicated it to others, and they to the King; who as it were, by Divine Inſpiration, ſaid, <hi>That the mention of a Blow, muſt needs be Interpreted of ſome Villain in a Corner, deſigning Miſchief by a Blaſt of Powder,</hi> and therefore willed them, as they tendered their Safeties, to Search well the Sellers and other Places; where in fine, under a heap of Faggots, they found twenty ſix Barrells of Gunpowder, with Iron Bars laid croſs them, and <hi>Guy Faux</hi> with a Dark-Lanthorn under
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57946:179"/>
his Coat, ready Booted and Spurred, to have rid away as ſoon as he had laid the Match to the Train.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Diſcovery, moſt of the Conſpirators Fled, but being Purſued, were either Killed or Apprehended, <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Peircy,</hi> the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Helliſh Contrivance, being ſhot through as they were Fighting Back to Back, and Sr. <hi>Everard Digby, John,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher Wright, Sudio Fawkes,</hi> Father <hi>Garnet, Thomas Winter, Baites,</hi> and <hi>Keeys,</hi> were Condemned, and afterwards as Traytors, Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered.</p>
                  <p>For this ſignal Deliverance, the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons then Aſſembled in Parliament, made an Act for Conſtituting a Day of publick Thanksgiving, to be kept Annually for ever on the 5th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which his Majeſty was pleaſed to paſs with many Expreſſions of Joy.</p>
                  <p>Within a while after <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Rynolds,</hi> Induced the Commons of <hi>Northhamptonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> to riſe; but upon the Kings ſending down his Pardon, they ſoon diſperſed themſelves.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King's Daughter, was Married to <hi>Frederick</hi> Count Elector Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whoſe Nuptials were Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized with great Joy; but it laſted not long, by reaſon of the Death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who Dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1611. whereupon <hi>Charles</hi> the King's ſecond Son was made Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now Sr. <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> that famous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator, being Releaſed from his Impriſonment, Imbarqued with ſeveral Gentlemen and others, in order to his making new Diſcoveries, when Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at St. <hi>Thomes,</hi> he and his Company ſet it on Fire, of which, Complaint being made to <hi>Gundiber,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ambaſſador, Reſiding in the Engliſh
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57946:179"/>
Court, he preſſed the King continually for Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, inſomuch, that when Sr. <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> returning with great Spoil, Landed at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> he was Arreſted by an Order from the King, and brought Priſoner to <hi>London;</hi> when coming to his Tryal before the Judges of the King-Bench, he was found Guilty, and the Morning after his Tryal Beheaded.</p>
                  <p>The Air being much Infected about this time, the King and Queen fell ſick, whereof the good Queen dyed, to the great Grief of the King, which had nigh made him Relaps after his Recovery: And now he began to take more than ordinary Care for the thorough Setlement of Religion, by beſtowing great Revenues upon Colledges, and other Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of Learning; as likewiſe utterly Aboliſhed all the Fragments of Popery, which again began to creep into the Church; which made the Papiſts Contrive many Ways to Deſtroy him, but all their Plots, and Helliſh Contrivances, through Gods Infinite Mercy were Fruſtrated, and came to nothing.</p>
                  <p>About this time the King made a Motion of Marriage for his Son Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> purpoſing thereby to ſtrengthen his Alliance, in order to aſſiſt his Brother-in-Law, who by the German Princes was choſen King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but had been driven out of <hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperor, and deprived of his Principalities, and at that time remained at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Effect this Marriage, the Prince accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and ſeveral other Noble Perſonages, went to the Spaniſh Court, but finding many Delays, they returned much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied: And now the King having ſetled the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57946:180"/>
and Temporal Affairs of the Kingdom, fell ſick, and his Sickneſs ſtill increaſing, he on the 27 Day of <hi>March Anno</hi> 1625, dyed, it being the 23d. Year of his Reign, and of his Age 59: He was Buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being the 44 ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>KIng <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt was Born at <hi>Dumferling</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> on the 19th. of <hi>November Anno</hi> 1600, being ſecond Son to King <hi>James,</hi> and his Wife Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> Siſter to the King of <hi>Denmark:</hi> In his younger Years he was brought up in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Learning fit for ſo Pious a Prince, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to Study, rather then to delight in the Gallantries of the Court, ſo that he for Piety and Learning was the Wonder of his Age.</p>
                  <p>When the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> came to take their Leaves of King <hi>James,</hi> upon his Departure for <hi>England,</hi> an old Laird amongſt the reſt, after he had made his Complements to the King, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Duke <hi>Charles</hi> and Saluted him, without any Reſpect to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who was preſent; at which the King Marvelling, asked him the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom the Laird Anſwered, <hi>That this was he that ſhould Tranſmit his Name to Poſterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When his Brother, Prince <hi>Henry</hi> dyed; he was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57946:180"/>
chief Mourner, and within a while after was made Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and continued to behave himſelf Humble and Courteous towards all ſorts and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men: Sometime before the Death of King <hi>James,</hi> he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> to proſecute a Marriage between himſelf and the Lady <hi>Maria,</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> when by the way, continuing in the French Court, he there held ſome Converſe with the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and Siſter to the then Reigning King, on whom he ſo far ſetled his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that he had no great regard to the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and after the Death of his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was no ſooner Crowned, but he ſent over his Ambaſſador to Treat of Marriage, which was agreed accordingly, and the Princeſs Landed at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Attended with the chief Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> where the King with a very ſplendid Train met her, and ſoon after the Nuptials were Celebrated with all Joy and Splendor Imaginable.</p>
                  <p>This good Prince being thus ſetled in his Throne, began to call to mind ſome Indignities that had been offered during his ſtay in the Spaniſh Court, whereupon a Fleet was put to Sea, which greatly Indamaged the Spaniards, taking many rich Prizes, which they brought into the ſeveral Harbours of this Kingdom; after which a Parliament was called, and Subſidy demanded, but it was denyed, altho the Treaſures were Exhauſted, and the War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken againſt the Spaniard, Juſt and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Whereupon the King was forced to take o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meaſures for procuring Mony to defray the Expence; and joyning in Amity with the States General of the United Provinces, he again put a gallant Navy to Sea, which indamaged the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57946:181"/>
more than the former, and amongſt the reſt ſome French Ships were taken by the Engliſh, which cauſed an Imbargo to be laid upon the Ships and Goods of ſeveral Engliſh Merchants then tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that Kingdom, whereupon all Frenchmen were commanded to leave <hi>England,</hi> but at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of <hi>Monſieur Baſempiere</hi> that Decree was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voaked, but all Commerce was ſtrictly forbidden with that Nation.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Rochellers (being Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants) were ſore Oppreſſed, and beſought our King to take them into his Protection, whereupon an Army was raiſed and ſent under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> but effected no great matter; whereupon ſome of the Officers were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for their Neglect and Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>And now ſeveral Complaints being exhibited upon this Account by the Parliament; the King Diſſolved them, and new Forces were Raiſed for the Relief of <hi>Rochel,</hi> but all was prevented by the Death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly and baſely Stabbed by one <hi>John Felton,</hi> who had Served under him in the late Expedition; for which he was deſervedly Hanged in Chains near <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Rochellers being tired with a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seige, and a worſe Famine (in which all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Filth was eaten, and accounted dainty Food) yeilded to their mercileſs Enemies.</p>
                  <p>About this time the King called another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſired of them a grant of Tunnage, but they refuſing to comply with his Demands were Diſſolved, upon which ſome Conteſts aroſe, the King commanding the Merchants to pay their Cuſtoms, and the Parliament, when ſitting, to the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57946:181"/>
contrary, inſomuch that Sr. <hi>John Elliot</hi> and others were Impriſoned.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th. of <hi>May Anno</hi> 1630, the Queen was brought to Bed of Prince <hi>Charles</hi> (now our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soveraign) and ſome time after Ship-Mony was deviſed by Attorny-General <hi>Noy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Impriſoned for refuſing to Pay it, and Sentence paſſed againſt him by ten of the Judges, Judg <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Judg <hi>Crook</hi> only diſſenting.</p>
                  <p>The Book of Liturgy being ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> with a Command to read it in all Churches, cauſed great Diſturbances in <hi>Edenburg</hi> and other Places, which being fomented by ſeveral Factious Spirits, ſoon broke out into a Rebellion, whereupon the King raiſed an Army and Marched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Scots laying down their Arms, upon their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion were Pardoned, and a Peace Concluded, but new Stirs ariſing after the King's Departure, he made his ſecond Expedition, but nothing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was done.</p>
                  <p>Within a while after, the Covenant, that Bond of Iniquity, was taken by many thouſands of that Kingdom; ſo that the King being Apprehenſive of the Miſchief that was like to attend it, Summoned a third Parliament to ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Supply of Mony for his preſent Occaſions, but they denyed to grant it.</p>
                  <p>And now the Iriſh Rebellion breaking out (wherein were committed many horrible Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) the Long Parliament (for ſo it was called, by reaſon they had prevailed with the King to ſign a Bill for their Sitting during their Pleaſure) uſed many Endeavours to Suppreſs the ſame; but whil'ſt they endeavoured to Suppreſs remote Troubles, they Fomented worſe nearer Home, by propoſing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57946:182"/>
an Alteration in the Divine Worſhip, under a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reducing Religion to what it was in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days, when indeed there was no Derogation from it in Fundamentals: The next Deſign they undertook to Provoke the beſt of Kings, was, to Impeach ſuch Favourits as were deareſt to him, of High Treaſon, as the Earl of <hi>Strafford, William Laud</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> who were ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> as likewiſe moſt of the Judges that had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for Ship-Mony were Voted Delinquents, Judg <hi>Berkly</hi> being Arreſted by the Uſher of the black Rod for High Treaſon, as he was ſitting in the Court of Kings-Bench; ſeven Romiſh Prieſts were likewiſe Impriſoned, whoſe Pardon was granted by the Parliament, at the Requeſt of the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and the King to comply with what the Parliament had done, Releaſed them out of Priſon, which the Parliament, by reaſon they were not firſt made acquainted with it, took in ſuch evil Part, that they reſolved to Thwart the King and his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whereupon they changed their Decree, and cauſed two of the Prieſts to be put to Death, which much diſpleaſed the King (as indeed it could no leſs) inſomuch that he complained of the Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the lower Houſe, to the Houſe of Peers, and within a while after proceeded to Diſplace ſome Officers of State, as likewiſe the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> putting another in his ſtead; which was no ſooner done, but the Commons Articled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the new Lieutenant to the Peers, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to meddle therein, as being the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in ſuch Caſes to Place and Diſplace at his Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The Factious being herein Fruſtrated, dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57946:182"/>
with the Mobile, and by diſperſing their Agents into ſeveral Cabals and publick Aſſemblies, to Breath into them the Poiſon of Rebellion, they cauſed the giddy-headed Multitude ſo far to forget their Loyalty and Obedience, that a confuſed Rable of Apprentices and others headed by Jeſuits and Phanaticks, came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> crying, that they would have the new Lieutenant removed, or elſe they would turn all things into Confuſion; altho few of them knew the Man or his Principles, any farther then they had taken it on Truſt: They likewiſe Demanded, according to the Inſtructions of their Ringleaders, that the Biſhops ſhould be Excluded the Parliament Houſe; and to ſhew their fooliſh Malice, they entered <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> and there fell to pulling down the Organs, tearing the Bibles and Common-Prayer-Books, defacing the Monuments of the Dead and the like, and then retreating; the ſecond time Aſſaulted <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> uttering many oprobrious Speeches againſt his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe Commotions the King began to think it high time to Fortify himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ordered a Guard to watch the Court, for the better Preſervation of his Royal Perſon.</p>
                  <p>And now the Parliament having brought things to this Paſs, they reſolved to proſecute their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Purpoſes, and thereupon feigning a Fear, they placed a Guard, far exceeding the Kings, about the Parliament Houſe, Conſtituting the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Captain thereof; and without the Kings Knowledg or Conſent, cauſed an extraordinary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to meet in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Ingratiate themſelves with the rigid Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, Anabaptiſts, Independants, Quakers, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57946:183"/>
the like, they caſt twelve Biſhops into Priſon, which did not a little trouble the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, the noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and within two Years after, the truly Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and great Pillar of the Church, <hi>William Laud</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who died Sacrifices to popular Fury, and Martyrs for their Country and Kingly Government, to ſatisfy the Malice of thoſe that had undertaken the Downfall of Monarchy, ſuppoſing there was no eaſier way to atchieve their wicked Purpoſes, than to remove thoſe wiſe Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and loyal Subjects.</p>
                  <p>And now the King growing Impatient at ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies, proceeded to Accuſe one Member of the Houſe of Lords and five of the Commons of high Treaſon; but demanding them to be delivered up, they were denyed, whereupon he went in Perſon with five hundred Gentlemen, and alone entered the Houſe: But not ſeeing the Perſons he came to look for, he declared his good Intentions to the Parliament, and ſo returned, and the next Day went again, but they having Notice, made their Eſcapes. Hereupon the Parliament put the City in Arms, and Adjourned their Sitting for the ſpace of five Days, forbidding the Citizens to Aſſiſt the Kings Officers in finding out thoſe Members that were Accuſed; which Order they Obeyed, and when the Parliament Sate again, the armed Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brought them, and placed them in the Houſe in deſpite of the King; and ſo being backed by the Multitude, they proceeded daily to leſſen the Royal Authority, ſending Letters into the adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, commanding them to draw up in Arms, ſo that on that Occaſion above twenty thouſand Men were in a readineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:57946:183"/>Upon theſe harſh Proceedings of the Parliament, the King haſted to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> and now the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament daily Increaſing in Power, they Adjourned their Sitting to <hi>Guildhall</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> the better to Ingratiate themſelves with the Citizens; and from thence ſent their Mandates to the reſpective Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Seaport-Towns, forbidding them to yeild Obedience to the Kings Orders, unleſs they had Confirmed them: And in this they more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced his Affairs then they had formerly done, for had the King put Gariſons in thoſe Towns, he might have ſecured the Maritine part of Power, and by that means have Diſtreſſed the City of <hi>London,</hi> who once finding a faleur in Traffique, would ſoon have been weary of their Gueſt, whoſe Perverſeneſs occaſioned it. But the Parliament taking the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſecured them firſt, by putting ſtrong Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons into moſt of them: So that the King being in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> was denyed Entrance into his Town of <hi>Hull</hi> by Sr. <hi>John Hotham,</hi> whereupon returning to <hi>Windſor,</hi> he wrote to the Parliament, declaring his good meaning towards them, proteſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Innocent of ſuch things as had been Objected againſt him, whereupon they ſent Meſſengers to deſire his Return to <hi>London;</hi> but his Majeſty did not at ſuch a Juncture think it convenient; upon which the Lower Houſe drew up a Remonſtrance, wherein their Propoſitions were ſo unreaſonable, that the Houſe of Peers would by no means Accord with them therein, till they perceived the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were uniting themſelves againſt them, and ſo through Fear were compelled to a Complyance; and then the ſaid Remonſtrance was ſent to the King, who with ſome Reſervation yielded to one part of it, and rejected the other; but this would
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57946:184"/>
not ſatisfy thoſe unreaſonable Men, but they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the King, that the accuſed Members might be free and clear from all Guilt; to which the good King out of his princely Lenity conſented.</p>
                  <p>Things being at this Paſs, many who favoured the Kings Cauſe, foreſeeing the diſmal Effects, ſome of them left <hi>England,</hi> and others repaired home, not leaving above twenty five in the upper Houſe, and ſcarce eighty in the Lower; and thoſe moſt, if not all of them, ſuch as were ſtrong Oppoſers of the Kings Proceedings, and thoſe that they did in the leaſt ſuſpect to be loyally Affected, by one means or other they got them turned out, till at laſt there was not above ſixteen in the Lords Houſe.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Queen left <hi>England</hi> to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom ſhe was Eſpouſed; and by reaſon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or Rump, (for now it was no other) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Nation was in danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with Popery, and thereby ſet the giddy headed Multitude a madding, (who ſaw not at what thoſe Foxes aimed) the King put forth his Proclamation, commanding all Popiſh Prieſts to avoid the Realm upon Pain of Death, as likewiſe to put the Laws in Execution againſt Papiſts, but nothing would pleaſe thoſe whoſe Aim was to Ingroſs the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power into their own Hands; for now they began to appear more barefaced, and contrary to their own Belief, Accuſed the King of hearkening to a Change of Religion; and that he was the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Iriſh Rebellion; and proceeded to blacken all thoſe that had any ſpark of Loyalty, nay after they had vented their Malice againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, they proved ſo monſtrouſly wicked as to Aſperſe the Queen, which the King (who tendered
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57946:184"/>
her as his Life) took in ſuch grievous Part, that he Publiſhed his Declaration, declaring his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and how that the Parliament ſought all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Quarrel againſt him, and to proſecute their own evil Purpoſes, ſpread falſe Rumours amongſt his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>But this not having the wiſhed Effects, and things growing daily worſe and worſe, the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to oppoſe Force with Force, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taking with him his Son Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and others of the chief Nobility, he took his Journy for <hi>York,</hi> and from thence wrote to the Parliament, but finding them as Obſtinate as ever, he Summoned all the Knights of the Garter, and ſuch as held of the Crown, to repair to him; when on the contrary, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made it Death for any to go, but therein few obeyed them, for the Nobility from all parts came thither, as likewiſe many of the Members of the lower Houſe who had retired themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And now Preparation for War being made on all Hands, the Kentiſh Men Petitioned the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Behalf of the King, <hi>That nothing might be done without his Conſent, That the Liturgy might not be altered, but that Divine Worſhip might continue as by Law Eſtabliſhed, That the Biſhops might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, whom they had Excluded the Lords Houſe, that they would not ſuffer the fundamental Laws to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without the Kings Permiſſion, nor Arms to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up without the Kings Command, and that ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy means might be found out for an Amicable Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But altho they had formerly encouraged Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they ſerved for their Purpoſe, yet this Petition was taken in evil Part, and thoſe who

brought it, together with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> who received it at their Hands Impriſoned; and the <hi>Summerſetſhire</hi> Men afterwards preferring their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition upon the ſame Occaſion, the Parliament cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be burnt by the common Hangman, which ſhewed how little they were deſirous of Peace, but rather ſought Contention to bring their wicked Purpoſes about.</p>
                  <p>The King being at <hi>York,</hi> and finding no hopes of Reconciliation, Commanded all the <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Men to attend him at a Day prefixed on <hi>Howard More,</hi> which they accordingly did to the Number of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thouſand, where his Majeſty, the Prince, and ſeveral Nobles accompanied with ſix hundred Horſe met them, and after having Admoniſhed them to Loyalty, Peace, and a right Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, he diſmiſſed them, yet twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them would accompany him back to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>York,</hi> and then Expreſſing their Loyalty, and ready Obedience, they departed to their reſpective Habitations.</p>
                  <p>This great Aſſembly put the Parliament in ſome Fear, whereupon they borrowed a conſiderable Sum of Mony of the Londoners upon the publick Faith, and therewith raiſed an Army of two thouſand Horſe and ten thouſand Foot, when in the mean while the King having drawn together conſiderable Forces, endeavoured the taking of <hi>Hull,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſent to the Parliament, to deſire that matters might be amicably Reconciled (ſo deſirous of Peace was this good King) promiſing forthwith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to them if they would leave <hi>London</hi> and ſit in ſome other place, but according to their old Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy they refuſed; whereupon the King proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Proclaim all men guilty of Treaſon that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57946:185"/>
ſhould Aſſiſt them with Mony or other Neceſſaries; threatening the Londoners with the taking away their Liberties if they offended herein, and cauſed <hi>Newark,</hi> and <hi>Barwick</hi> to be Fortified, and again ſought the taking of <hi>Hull,</hi> but in vain, that place by reaſon of the Waters that almoſt Incompaſs it, being impregnible.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament having by this time drawn out their Forces, Proclaimed open War, declaring themſelves neceſſitated to take up Arms; but how true that was, I leave to the Judgment of all good Men: And now the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Captain of their Guard, is made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                  <p>The King having Notice of theſe Proceedings, Marched to <hi>Notingham</hi> and there ſet up his Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and thither repaired to him a great number of Nobility: And now it being come to open Wars, the Victory continued for a long time doubtful, ſometimes on the one ſide, and ſometimes on the other, with no ſmall effuſion of Blood, and the Lives of brave Men loſt, there not being leſs then eighty Thouſand killed on both ſides during that unhappy War.</p>
                  <p>All things being in a Flame, the Prince took Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the <hi>Scillyes,</hi> from whence he was Invited by the Parliament, to Return to <hi>London,</hi> but not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſafe to truſt his Perſon in the Hands of ſuch Men who had broken their Oaths of Allegiance, cancel'd their Loyalty, and devoted themſelves to the Service of the Prince of Darkneſs, he Sailed for <hi>Holland,</hi> and there continued at the <hi>Hague</hi> till the ſad News of his Royal Fathers Murther was brought thither.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Affairs being now grown Deſperate,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57946:186"/>
moſt places of Strength being in the Hands of the Parliament, and his Army waſted, he came with the remainder of his Forces to <hi>Oxford;</hi> but a ſtrait Siege being laid to it, and more Forces daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected out of all Parts, he deſpaired of its long holding out; and therefore by the Advice of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Nobility, he rode in Diſguiſe to the Scotch Army, who then lay Encamped near <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> caſting himſelf upon them for Protection, who at firſt made many fair Promiſes, and ſeemed a while ſharply to contend with the Parliament, when they demanded them to deliver the King into their Hands; but having great Arrears due for their late Service, they feared to loſe that if they refuſed to Comply, and thereupon, like perfidious Wretches delivered him into the Hands of his mercileſs Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for the Sum of two hundred thouſand Pounds; but it may ſomewhat abate our Wonder, when we conſider that <hi>Judas,</hi> whoſe Example they followed, ſold the King of Kings for thirty Pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>The Scots having got their Mony, Marched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland,</hi> leaving their King to be carried Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to <hi>Holmby,</hi> and afterwards to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where he was guarded by Collonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond;</hi> and during his Solitude there, he wrote his excellent Book called <hi>Icon Baſilice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Things being brought to this paſs, a Treaty was held, and Commiſſioners accordingly appointed to receive the Kings Conceſſions, which were ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that the Parliament Voted them Satisfactory; after which thoſe that ſought his Life, having no Cloak for their Villany, they began to appear in their proper Colours, turning out all ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, as they thought would refuſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57946:186"/>
to Comply with their wicked purpoſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the King to <hi>Hurſt Caſtle,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Windſor,</hi> during which many Skirmiſhes paſſed between the Loyaliſts and Rebels, as at <hi>Maidſtone, Pomfract, Bow, Stratford, Kingſton,</hi> and <hi>Preſton</hi> where the Scotch Army were overthrown, and laſtly at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> which was defended by the Renowned Worthies Sr. <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> and Sr. <hi>George Liſle,</hi> who upon the Surrender of that Town (cauſed through extream Famine (notwithſtanding they had their Lives granted, yet in cold Blood) they were ſhot to Death contrary to the Law of Arms.</p>
                  <p>And now the Army, Officers, and thoſe Members that were left in the Houſe, Erected a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Tribunal, falſly called a High Court of Juſtice; <hi>For indeed Juſtice was turned into Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in thoſe Days;</hi> and of this Court Serjeant <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi> was made Preſident, and the King being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the new Erected and pretended Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had ſeveral Crimes laid to his Charge, as that he gave cauſe of the cruel Bloodſhed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That he had born Arms againſt the Parliament, That he had given Commiſſion to his Son, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to wage War, and therefore he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a Traitor, a Tyrant, and an Enemy to the Kingdom, by <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> the worſt of Traytors that ever <hi>England</hi> bred.</p>
                  <p>But the King diſowned the Power of that Court, and therefore refuſed to Anſwer to the Charge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he was ſeveral times brought thither and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto: But theſe Hellhounds thirſting after Royal Blood, only ſet up this Court for Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Sake, the better to colour their Villany, they having beforehand, paſt Doubt, reſolved his Death.</p>
                  <p>The King having abſolutely refuſed to Anſwer
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57946:187"/>
to their Charge, on the 17th. of <hi>April Anno</hi> 1648. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> to his immortal Shame, proceeded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sentence on the beſt of Kings: Which was to this Effect, <hi>That He the ſaid</hi> Charles Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art, <hi>was fallen from all Dignity, was guilty of high Treaſon, and was to be put to Death by the ſevering his Head from his Body, for being a Tyrant, a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, and an Enemy to the Commonwealth:</hi> In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Sentence the Court ſtood up, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignifying that they all Conſented to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and the King offering to ſpeak, <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> would not permit him, but ordered the Officers to take him away, and carry him to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now this wicked Sentence being thus Paſſed, few imagined that they would be ſuch Villains as to have dared the putting it in Execution; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Interceſſions of the Dutch Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and many of the Nobility, on the 30th. of <hi>January,</hi> at the Command of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> a Scaffold was Erected before <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and covered with Black, which made many aking Hearts, and cauſed ſuch as durſt of the Nobility, to Addreſs themſelves to the Tyrants for the Kings Life; &amp; the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> declared that rather then ſuch a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſhould be acted, if none other would Aſſiſt him, himſelf with his Regiment would force the Guards and attempt the Hindering it; but <hi>Cromwell</hi> &amp; ſome of the Principal Rumpers got him to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (as they termed it) to ſeek of God what was beſt to be done, but indeed to Conſult the Devil, who (paſt doubt (had all along been their Councellor) and in the mean while the fatal Blow was given: For the King being brought out of the Banquetting Houſe, upon a Bridg of Boards that was laid from the Window to the Scaffold, attended by Dr <hi>Juxon,</hi>

he in a Learned and Pious Speech Addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the People, declaring his Innocence; and then deſiring of God to Forgive his Adverſaries, he gave his <hi>George</hi> to Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> and bid him <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> which was, as 'tis ſuppoſed, to deliver it to the Prince, and then laying down his Royal Head, after he had Recommended his Spirit into the Hands of his Redeemer, he had it ſtricken off at a Blow by an Executioner in Diſguiſe.</p>

                  <p>This Murther in the ſuperlative Degree acted by rebellious Subjects upon their lawful Prince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Precedent, did not a little Aſtoniſh the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, and drew Tears not only from his Friends, but his Enemies; nay from Strangers, who had only heard of the Virtues of this good King, which were indeed ſo many, that ſhould I go about to recite them, it would prove too hard a Task, and might fill up a larger Volume.</p>
                  <p>His Body was put in a Coffin covered with black Velvet, and carried to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and there wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Lead, when about ſeven Days after it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to two of his Servants, to be Diſpoſed of as they thought fit; upon Notice of which the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Lindſy</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> together with Dr. <hi>Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> came and putting it in a Herſe Conveyed it to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and Interred it in St. <hi>Georg</hi>'s Chappel, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in private the Requiems of ſo great a King, and for a Memorial, fixed a piece of Lead about two

                  <p>During theſe Paſſages, his Majeſty Proſecuted his Voyage for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Arriving at <hi>Spey,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lords came to Welcome him, as likewiſe to Accompany him to <hi>Edenburg,</hi> when as all the way he Paſſed, great was the Joy of the People; at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>The King being now come to <hi>Edenburg,</hi> he was there Proclaimed King on the 15th. of <hi>July Anno</hi> 1650, but his Coronation was Deferred by reaſon of the Troubles that were then ariſen; for the Engliſh Army under the Command of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> was by this time entered the Frontiers; whereupon great Forces were Raiſed to Oppoſe them under the Leading of <hi>Montgomery;</hi> who gave the Engliſh Battail at <hi>Dunbarr,</hi> but were worſted: And now, notwithſtanding the Engliſh Army was Victorious even in the Heart of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet ſuch was the ill Hap, that the Scots themſelves were at Strife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divided into three Parties, ſo that they could expect no other then to be worſted. To heal theſe Breaches his Majeſty earneſtly Laboured, inſomuch that through his Princely Wiſdom, he at laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a Reconciliation, whereupon all the Eſtates unanimouſly reſolved to Crown his Majeſty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more to Abaſh the Rebels, which on the firſt Day of <hi>January Anno</hi> 1650 was Performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly at <hi>Scoon</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the King ſet up his Standard at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> Reſerving to himſelf the Title of Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo of the Scotch Army, when as News came that Sr. <hi>Henry Hide,</hi> and Captain <hi>Buſhel</hi> had been Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at <hi>London</hi> by the Rebels for their Loyalty. The Engliſh Army ſtill Approaching, the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>Sterling,</hi> and leaving St. <hi>Johnſtown,</hi> went thither with his whole Court, but was no ſooner Arrived there, but News was brought of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> and his Son.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57946:191"/>
Rump who had ſtill their Spies abroad, diſcovered a new Plot againſt themſelves, carryed on by the Presbyterians, for which Mr. <hi>Gibons,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Love</hi> were Beheaded, <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeeing he could not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Scots to a Field-Battel, for that they had Encamped in <hi>Fife,</hi> he therefore Tranſported ſixteen hundred Foot, and four Troops of Horſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River, who joyning with <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Okeys</hi> Forces, Routed Sr. <hi>John Brown,</hi> and altho he made a brave Reſiſtance, yet he was taken Priſoner, and with him ſeveral Perſons of Quality, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a hundred common Souldiers, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were killed upon the Place.</p>
                  <p>Fortune being thus averſe to his Majeſties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he reſolved to try an other way, by leaving <hi>Scotland</hi> and making <hi>England</hi> the Seat of War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon on the 30th. of <hi>July Anno</hi> 1651, he Marched his Army into <hi>England,</hi> of which <hi>Cromwell</hi> had no ſooner Notice, but he ſent <hi>Lambert</hi> after with a Party of Horſe to fall upon the Rear of the Kings Army, himſelf, with ſuch other Forces as could be ſpared, Marching to ſecond him; the Rump like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hearing of his Majeſties Approach, ſent their Mandates into all Counties, that none ſhould be ſo hardy as to Aſſiſt him with Men or Mony, under the Penalty of High Treaſon (when indeed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were the worſt of Traytors) as likewiſe cauſed Forces to be Raiſed in each County to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him.</p>
                  <p>The King having entered <hi>England,</hi> Commanded it to be Proclaimed, <hi>That no Soldier ſhould Offer Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to the Perſons or Houſes of any of his Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> which was Obeyed with due Obſervance, yet ſuch was the Peoples Fear of the Rump, that few (or none) came to the Aſſiſtance of their King, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57946:192"/>
the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eskrich</hi>'s Son with a Troop of Horſe.</p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Lambert</hi> being guided over the Moors and Dales in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> was got before the Kings Army, and thought to have ſtoped them at <hi>Warrington Bridg,</hi> but after a hot Diſpute, and the loſs of ſeveral Men on either Side, the Paſs was gained, and the King Marching with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Tong-Norton,</hi> ſent a Trumpet to Collonel <hi>Humphry Mackworth,</hi> Governour of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to Summon him to deliver up the Town, but he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and was ſo Inſolent, as not to own his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by any other Title than Commander in Chief of the Scotch Army, as appeared by the Superſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Letter he ſent back: From hence his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Marched to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and was joyfully Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed by ſeveral truly Loyal Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> having brought his Majeſty a Supply of two hundred and fifty Foot, and ſixty Horſe, Raiſed in the Iſle of Man, and in hopes to procure more, he went into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where he was ſet upon by <hi>Lilborn,</hi> and had moſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders Slain, as the Lord <hi>Witherington,</hi> Sr. <hi>Thomas Tilsby,</hi> Collonel <hi>Trollop,</hi> Collonel <hi>Bointon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, altho they behaved themſelves with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable Bravery, performing as much as Men could do.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton,</hi> where the Bridg was cut down, by cauſing his Troopers to ſwim their Horſes over the River, in order to Reſcue about fifty deſperate Fellows that had got over upon a Pole, and were driven by Major General <hi>Maſſy</hi>'s Men into a Church and there Beſieged, but the Troopers Landing, and thoſe fifty Sallying out of the Church, the Majors Men were forced to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, whereupon a Bridg of Boats was laid over the River; and now <hi>Cromwell</hi> joyning <hi>Lambert,</hi> the Loyaliſts were beat out of the Town, and ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> whether now the Rebels made their Approaches, and Incamped upon <hi>Red-hill,</hi> where they had been Surprized by the Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, had not a Raſcally Taylor diſcovered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſo that it came to a fair Battail, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on the third of <hi>September</hi> 1651, Sallying out of the Town at the Head of his Forces with King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bravery, and an undaunted Reſolution, Charged <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Life-Guard, and forced them to Retire, leaving many of their Fellows dead upon the place; but the Enemy being three to one in Number, were ſtill Recruited with freſh Supplies, ſo that after the Fight had remained Bloody and Doubtful for ſome Hours, when as the King bravely Fighting, having had two Horſes Shot under him, and many of his chief Commanders Slain, the Scale of War turned, and the Royal Party were forced to Retreat into the Town, which they did with much Difficulty, by reaſon a loaded Cart was overthrown in the Gateway, ſuppoſed to be done on purpoſe, which ſo obſtructed the Entrance of the Horſe that the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57946:193"/>
Enemy had time to come up, who entred pell mell with the Royaliſts, when as the Cry went, <hi>Save the King, Save the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty now Perceiving all to be loſt, with ſome of his moſt truſty Followers made his Eſcape out of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> altho not without great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and coming to a Farm Houſe on the Borders of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> his Majeſty there Refreſhed himſelf, and the better to prevent Diſcovery, cut off his Hair, and changed his Aparrel; yet was purſued ſo cloſe that at <hi>Boſcobel Houſe</hi> the Troopers entered the fore Dore, and his Majeſty went out at the Back, and coming into a Wood, made an Oake his Pallace whil'ſt the Blood-Hounds had left Purſuing him in thoſe Parts; and afterwards by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Pendrills</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> having eſcaped through miraculous Providence many Dangers, he found means to paſs the Seas, and landed ſafe at <hi>New Haven</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and in this Gods Goodneſs was evidently Demonſtrated, for altho his Majeſty was in the Hands of Men of mean Fortune, who might have made their own Price with the Rebels to betray him (one thouſand Pounds being the firſt Penny the Rump had ſet upon his Head) as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his Life lay in the Hands of Women, whoſe Breſts rarely Contain ſo weighty a Secret long; yet no Temptation could prevail with them to prove Perfidious to the beſt of Kings.</p>
                  <p>In the Battle of <hi>Worceſter</hi> about three thouſand were Slain, and ſeven hundred taken Priſoners, upon News of which the Rump cauſed publick Days of Thankſgiving to be kept, and cauſed the Scoth Colours taken in the Fight to be hung up in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Hall:</hi> And now the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to make his Eſcape, fell into the Hands of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57946:193"/>
the Rebells, who without any due Proceſs of Law Beheaded him at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>New Haven</hi> the King went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and having ſtayed there a while, he went to St. <hi>Germaines,</hi> there to Confer with the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> about the Recovery of his Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but it came to no Reſult. During his Majeſties Abode there, the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who had a long time been detained by the Parliament in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> came to him from the <hi>Hague,</hi> Accompanyed with Sr. <hi>Richard Greenvil,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> and not long after Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> who had been Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in his Majeſties making his Eſcape out of <hi>England,</hi> for which ſhe was now kindly Received, and had many Thanks given her by his Majeſty for her Care and good Will towards him.</p>
                  <p>About this time <hi>Cromwell</hi> intending to aſſume to himſelf an abſolute Power, Diſſolved the Rump Parliament, which had ſat twelve Years ſix Months and ſeventeen Days, and after that they were cryed about the Streets in Deriſion, four Parliament men for a Penny, ſo Odious and Hateful were they now grown amongſt the People, and within a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter War was Proclaimed with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in which happened five bloody Ingagements, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh got the better; the Dutch having loſt moſt of their great Ships, were forced to ſue for Peace, which with much Difficulty they obtained; and now <hi>Cromwell</hi> perceiving the People began to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his uſurped Authority, he called another fagend of a Parliament, Compoſed for the moſt part of Mechanicks, who not knowing how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affairs of State, within a while after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up their Power to old <hi>Noll,</hi> from whom they received it, and departed to mind the Buſineſs they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57946:194"/>
better underſtood, upon which, <hi>viz.</hi> the 16th. of <hi>December</hi> 1653, <hi>Cromwell</hi> by the Procurement of his own Creatures was Sworn Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and by that means the Democracy for which the Rebels had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was diſſolved by a Creature of their own making, whom yet the boldeſt of them durſt not Oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>The King during theſe Proceedings being in <hi>France,</hi> ſought to make Peace between that Crown and the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and hoping yet to further his Intereſt he departed for <hi>Germany,</hi> Accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and ſuch Nobility as then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, and Arriving at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> his Royal Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> came to Viſit him, and there his Majeſty diverted himſelf for ſome time, during which <hi>Cromwell</hi> was buſy in ſetling his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon as ſure a Foundation as he could, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch to Death (under pretence of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring againſt the Government) whom he thought were moſt likely to Oppoſe his Tyranny: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time Collonel <hi>Gerrard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wowel</hi> were put to Death, for he had his Agents in all parts of <hi>England</hi> ſecretly to pry into mens Actions, and to ſee how they ſtood Affected <hi>(For Tyranny is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with Meſtruſt and Fear)</hi> and theſe Rakehells were wont to trapan Gentlemen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves for the King, pretending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the ſame time great Royaliſts, and railing againſt the Uſurper, till ſuch time they had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Ends, and then upon their Informing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, their Eſtates and Lives were at the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers Mercy, none of his Judges daring to Aquit a Perſon (tho never ſo Innocent) that <hi>Cromwell</hi> would have Condemned; for his Motto might well

be the ſame that is written over the Pallace Gate of the Grand Signeour.</p>

                  <p>For indeed never was any People under pretence of Liberty brought into ſuch Slavery, and yet it was Death to complain, or ſo much as murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Protectors Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Scots Riſing under the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Earl of <hi>Glencairn, Monro,</hi> and <hi>Middleton,</hi> reſolved to proſecute the Kings Cauſe, but being Routed by General <hi>Monk,</hi> all came to nothing. The King having left the <hi>Spaw,</hi> was now arrived at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> and there himſelf and the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> were Royally Entertained, and ſhortly after they were Invited by the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> to his Pallace of <hi>Dunſel-Dorf,</hi> where they met with the like Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; and here it was that the King and his Siſter parted, the former returning to <hi>Cullen,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During theſe Paſſages the Uſurper diſcovered another Plot by means of his Agents, which was to have been a general Riſing all over <hi>England,</hi> whereupon ſeveral worthy Perſons were Executed, and ſome hundreds ſent beyond Sea, and ſold for Slaves.</p>
                  <p>And now the King with his Brother the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and his Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> attended by a great Train of Nobility, went to <hi>Frankfort,</hi> and at <hi>Coningſtem</hi> near <hi>Frankfort, Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweeden</hi> gave the King a Viſit, after which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57946:195"/>
he returned again to <hi>Collen,</hi> and from thence into the Low-Countries, being Invited thither by <hi>Don John d' Auſtria</hi> Governour thereof under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whither his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> came to him.</p>
                  <p>The War continuing between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain, Cromwell</hi> according to a Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> ſent over ſix thouſand Foot Soldiers to Aſſiſt that King in his Wars againſt <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in Lieu thereof he was to have <hi>Dunkirk</hi> delivered into his Poſſeſſion, which being afterwards taken with great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was accordingly put into the Poſſeſſion of the Engliſh: And now the Protector deſirous of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Advancement, called an Aſſembly of his own Creatures, who durſt not move but by his Dictates, of which Sr. <hi>Thomas Witherington</hi> being Speaker, it was by them Ordained that the Protector ſhould be Cloathed in Purple Robes and Inſtalled in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall,</hi> after which he Eſtabliſhed a Pajeant Houſe of Lords of his own Creation, as <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> the <hi>Qondam</hi> Cobler, the Lord <hi>Clapole,</hi> Lord <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the like; when wanting Treaſure to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his upſtart Greatneſs, he ſent his Scouts upon the Diſcovery, who brought him News of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pregnant Plot, which was juſt about to Teem, whereupon Sr. <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> were Executed, and Mr. <hi>Aſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Betly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stacy</hi> Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered, and their Eſtates ſeiſed and Sold by the Protector (a Politick, tho a wicked Invention to get Mony.)</p>
                  <p>And now the Pomp of this bluſtering Tyrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at its higheſt Pitch, he made his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and appointed Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in moſt Parts of <hi>England</hi> for the Approbation of Miniſters and Schoolmaſters, with ample Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57946:195"/>
to Eject ſuch as were Ignorant, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of which all the well Affected and Learned Men were turned out, and any Blockheads placed in their ſteads that could but raiſe any conſiderable Sum of Mony: <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> was kept by <hi>Cromwell</hi> in the nature of his Jeſter; it was alſo Enacted by one of <hi>Nols</hi> mechanick Parliaments, that no Perſon ſhould be Married but by a Juſtice of Peace, and firſt to be Asked in the Church, or Proclaimed in the Market. And now the Tyrants Power began to Decline, the People every where Inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in Private, altho they durſt not do it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly: And now their Eyes being open, they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned in what Miſeries their mad Folly had Involved them, and would willingly have ſhook off the Tyrants Yoke, but found it ſtick too faſt.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>September Anno</hi> 1658, <hi>Cromwell</hi> began to ſetle his Affairs, and make a more narrow Inſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matters, as finding a Decay of his bodily Health, and was very deſirous to ſettle his Son <hi>Richard</hi> in the Kingdom, if he ſhould at that time Deceaſe, for on the firſt Day of the Month aforeſaid, he was ſenſible of Change, and therefore ſent for thoſe whom he had raiſed from a low Eſtate to great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and conſulted them about the matter, who promiſed to ſtand by his Son <hi>Richard;</hi> ſo that his Sickneſs ſtill encreaſing, on the third of <hi>September,</hi> in Year aforeſaid, he yeilded to Death, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his own Example, admitted neither of Bail nor Mainpriſe. The Day whereon he dyed (as it was obſerved) the like Storm had not happened in many Ages paſt, for by the Violence thereof Trees, Houſes, Barns, Church-Steeples, Stacks of Hay and Corn were overthrown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:57946:196"/>After his Death he was Conveyed to <hi>Summerſet Houſe</hi> and there laid in State, where he continued till the 23d. of <hi>November</hi> following, and then was carried to <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> with all Magnificence and Splendor imaginable, and Interred near the Kings of <hi>England</hi> formerly buryed there.</p>
                  <p>The old Tyrant being removed, his Son <hi>Richard</hi> was Inveſted with his Power, but his Head being too light, and his Shoulders too weak to Support the ponderous Weight of Government; he after his having called a Parliament was decently laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide as a uſeleſs Tool, not fit to finiſh the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather unreform, and overthrow the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in outing <hi>Richard,</hi> called the Rump Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that had ben turned out by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who not a little Rejoyced that it was put into their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er again to Lord it over their Betters, and add yet more Sin to the former. But whil'ſt they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in ſetling themſelves <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Roſe under the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sr. <hi>George Booth</hi> in Defence of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges and to maintain the Kings Cauſe; againſt whom <hi>Lambert</hi> Advanced, and by him thoſe Loyal Gentlemen had the Misfortune to be Routed, and the Renouned Sr. <hi>George Booth</hi> now Lord <hi>De-la-Mere,</hi> ſhortly after taken and ſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> upon his Return was gratified with a thouſand Pounds by the Rump for his Service.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Lambert</hi> began to harbour ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Monopolizing the Government, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to himſelf the Power of <hi>Oliver,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he turned out the Rump and Erected a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Committee of Safety, all of his own Creatures, who were to inſpect into the Affair of the three Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>General <hi>Monk</hi> being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having notice of theſe Proceedings, concluded that now was the time to deliver his Country out of Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; whereupon he paſſed the <hi>Tweed</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and incamped at <hi>Cold Stream,</hi> there expecting the coming of <hi>Lambert,</hi> who advanced towards him, intending to give him battle, thinking that if he could but overthrow him, he ſhould not fail to ſit in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Chair. But whilſt he Incamped at <hi>New Caſtle,</hi> the Rump had got together again, and had diſſolved his Committee of Safety, and ſo dealt with the Officers of his Army, that firſt ſhewing the ſmall diſpoſition they had to fight General <hi>Monk,</hi> they afterwards left him to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as likewiſe all his Soldiers; after which the Rump ſent their Commiſſioners to General <hi>Monk</hi> to deſire him to March for <hi>London,</hi> which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did, and was petitioned by all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he paſſed through, if not by all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> for a Free Parliament.</p>
                  <p>He was no ſooner arrived at <hi>London,</hi> but the Rump to revenge ſome Indignities the Citizens had put upon them, ſet him to pull up their Poſts and Chains, as likewiſe to throw down their Gates, which made many that hoped well of him, doubt the Event; but aſſoon as he ſaw it convenient, he began to declare himſelf openly for a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, drawing his Troops into the City, who were now welcomed with great expreſſions of Joy.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing he put in practice, was, to reſtore the Secluded Members to their Places in the Houſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57946:197"/>
of Commons, upon which the Aſſembly diſſolved it ſelf, and Writs were Iſſued out to the ſeveral Cities, Counties, Burroughs, and Towns Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, for calling a New Parliament, which was called the <hi>healing Parliament,</hi> as indeed it was, for aſſoon as the Members had ſettled themſelves in the Houſe, they began to Vote for the King's Return to his People, which after a long Dehate was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Affirmative; whereupon the States Arms were every where pulled down, and the King's Arms ſet up in their Places, and on Tueſday the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> 1660. the King was Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>White Hall</hi> Gate, according to the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the great Joy of his Loving Subjects, who had long groaned under Tyranny and Oppreſſion, and immediately after Commiſſioners were ſent to the King to invite him and his Royal Brethren, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> (who then reſided at <hi>Breda</hi>) over into <hi>England;</hi> whereupon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſent Sir <hi>John Greenvill,</hi> and others before, to ſound the Hearts of the People, by whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving aſſurance of the longing Expectations of his Subjects for his Return, He with his Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and a great Train of Nobility landed at <hi>Dover,</hi> where he was met by the General, and greateſt part of the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> and there his Majeſty to expreſs his Gratitude, dignified Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk</hi> with the Honour of Knight of the Garter, himſelf putting the <hi>George</hi> about his Neck, his Brothers the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the mean while tying on the Garter, and when the General offered to kneel, the King took him up in his Arms and Imbraced him, and ſo with a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Train, his Majeſty marched towards <hi>London,</hi> whilſt great were the Expreſſions of Joy the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57946:197"/>
every where ſhewed for his Happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Black Heath</hi> the General's Army was drawn up, as likewiſe a great number of Nobility, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Scarlet, and ſome hundreds of Citizens lead by Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> in Velvet Coats, who with loud Shouts and Acclamations of Joy, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed his Majeſtie's Return; when the King had paſſed them, they fell into his Rear, and after them the General's Soldiers in Armour with their drawn Swords, and ſo with a Train that reacht two miles in length; his Majeſty was conducted through <hi>London</hi> to <hi>White Hall,</hi> whilſt the Citizens the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to expreſs their Joy had reared many ſtately Pageants, and cauſed the Conduits to run Wine, and the Night by the Light of the Fires that were every where kindled, ſeemed another Day.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>White Hall</hi> Gate was the Effigies of <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> ſet upon a Pole, and the Common-wealths Arms about his Neck, which after it had been a long time the Sport of the People, was thrown into the Fire prepared for that purpoſe, and thus ended the Triumph of the Happy Twenty ninth of <hi>May,</hi> which was doubly bleſſed, in being the Day of his Majeſtie's Birth and Reſtauration.</p>
                  <p>And now the Parliament being exceedingly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the King's Return to his People, Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that a Bill ſhould be prepared for keeping a perpetual Anniverſary, or day of Thankſgiving to return Praiſe to God for his Infinite Goodneſs in Reſtoring His Majeſty to be a Bleſſing to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which Twenty ninth of <hi>May</hi> is ſtill kept Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred by all Loyal and well affected Perſons.</p>
                  <p>The King being by Heavens Providence ſetled
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57946:198"/>
in his Royal Throne, the Parliament began to call ſuch to an account, as had been concerned in the late King's Murther, of which Twenty ſix were Convicted, and Nine of the Principal Executed, <hi>viz. Adrian Scroop, John Carew, Thomas Hariſon, John Joanes, Gregory Clement, Thomas Scot, John Cook, Hugh Peters,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Axtel,</hi> all of them ſuffering for High Treaſon, as they moſt juſtly deſerved; for although Divine Juſtice may delay for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet at laſt it will ſtrike home: And now his Majeſty being mindful of his Vows to Heaven, uſed great Diligence to ſettle Religion, that deareſt part of Government, by reſtoring the Church to its Purity of Worſhip, and ſetling thoſe Biſhops and Paſtors that had been expelled by the Rebels, in their Dioceſſes and Cures; the Common Prayer was again read in Churches to the content of all good Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Pious Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> coming over to viſit his Majeſty, fell ſick of the Small Pox, of which Diſtemper ſhe died, to the great grief of his Majeſty, and all his Subjects. And now the Devil envying the happy ſtate of this Kingdom, began again to ſtir up his Agents to moleſt our happy Peace; for in <hi>January</hi> after his Majeſties Reſtauration, one <hi>Venner</hi> a Wine Cooper, with his Phanatick Proſelytes Rebelled, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves for King Jeſus, and the Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ranged about the City like Madmen, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt a man in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church Yard, and then another in <hi>Beach Lane,</hi> without the leaſt provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the part of the deceaſed, and then making their Eſcapes into <hi>Cane-Wood;</hi> the third day after they entred <hi>London</hi> at ſeveral Gates (and paſt doubt imagining that more of the ſame Gange
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57946:198"/>
would have come to their Aſſiſtance, they fell to knocking down, and killing all they met with; ſo that the Trained Bands and part of the King's Life-guard oppoſing them, there was above Forty Perſons ſlain on both ſides; but at laſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder were taken, and being condemned as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traytors, they were Executed in ſeveral Parts of the City, dying obſtinate and juſtifying themſelves to the laſt.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Thirtieth of <hi>January,</hi> 1660. the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trunks of <hi>Oliver Cromwel, John Bradſhaw,</hi> and <hi>Henry Ireton,</hi> were taken up and carried to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where they were hanged at each Angle of the Triple Tree till Sun-ſet, and then their Bodies caſt into a Pit under the Gallows, and their Heads fixed on Poles, and ſet upon <hi>Weſtminſter Hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During theſe Proceedings the Pious Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> left this Life for that more durable, and on the Twenty third of <hi>April,</hi> 1661. his Majeſty was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> having the day before paſſed in great Splendour, from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus notwithſtanding all the Popiſh and Fanatical Plots and Deſigns, has the beſt of Kings been preſerved to this day, God having at ſundry times fruſtrated and brought to nought all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious devices of wicked men, and cauſed the miſchief they intended to others, to fall upon their own heads, as hath been ſeen in the miraculous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery of the late damnable Popiſh Plots, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the Deſigns of the late Rebels in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and likewiſe the ſubtle underhand contrivances of the diſaffected, whilſt under his proſperous Reign we enjoy all that Subjects can lawfully expect, or is convenient to be enjoyed; therefore let every
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57946:199"/>
good Subject make it his dayly Prayer to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, That His Reign may be long and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous over us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>And they that will not, may they Traytors dye,</l>
                     <l>To ſhame themſelves, and their Poſterity.</l>
